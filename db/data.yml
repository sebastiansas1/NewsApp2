    - 'Sound and vision: how a blind photographer shot the Games'
    - Australian Andrew Follows is blind in one eye and has tunnel vision in the other,
      but his sense of hearing – and his labrador Leo – helped him capture the spirit
      of the Commonwealth Games

    - With Leo, his labrador, fast asleep on the pool deck, Andrew Follows focused
      his lens on the victorious swimmers parading around in front of him. For some
      of the athletes, the sight of a guide dog snoozing at poolside was incongruous
      – as was the realisation they were being snapped by a visually impaired photographer.
      “People see me with a dog and they see me with a big camera and they go, ‘Am
      I seeing this right?!’” says Follows, who has spent the past week shooting at
      the Commonwealth Games. “The medal winners were all looking down at Leo and
      he’s asleep; he doesn’t have a care in the world. “Shooting the Games has been
      epic, absolutely epic,” he adds. “From the opening ceremony to the end of the
      swimming finals, I’ve captured some really magic moments.” Main portrait of
      Andrew Follows and Leo by Carly Earl for the Guardian The 56-year-old from Melbourne
      was born with a form of retinitis pigmentosa, a rare genetic disorder in which
      the cells of the retina are unable to sufficiently process light. Blind in one
      eye, his vision in the other is so poor he cannot rely on it to compose or time
      his images. “I’ve had retinitis pigmentosa from birth so I’ve never had good
      eyesight,” he says. “I’ve got no vision in my left eye and in my right eye I’ve
      got tunnel vision with about three metres of clear vision – the average person
      has 70 metres – so it’s pretty crap. “Over the years I’ve developed techniques
      [for making photographs] and it works well for the swimming, especially. I’m
      using my hearing to follow the sound of the water splashing and the crowd. “You
      know that the end of the race is coming when the crowd gets louder and louder
      and louder. I just focus the camera on the end blocks and start pressing that
      shutter button. I’m not seeing the results until I see them on the computer
      but I get really excited when I see them.” Indeed, Follows credits digital photography
      as being a transformative influence in his life. “I’ve always been involved
      in photography, even back in the old film days,” he says, “but since I bought
      my first digital camera in 2006 it’s opened up a whole new world of vision because
      you take the photos, you put the card into the computer, and all of a sudden
      you can see a lot clearer the shapes and textures and expressions on people’s
      faces – everything – so the camera has really become my eyes and allowed me
      to see what everybody else can see. I deeply love photography. It’s my passion
      now.” Follows is one of a growing legion of visually impaired photographers
      around the world and it is thanks to his friend, the photographer Delly Carr,
      that he was granted a media pass for the Games. His guide dog is fairly new
      to the role of assistant photographer but it’s work to which he’s perfectly
      suited. Leo even has his own media credentials and the ID number 007. “I’ve
      only had him nine months but he’s totally, 100% devoted to me. He utterly adores
      me and he just goes with the flow. He nailed it around the Games” – even if
      he did spend half of it sleeping. All pictures below by Andrew Follows Swimmers

    - The Northern Territory government will invest $25m to upgrade town camps, starting
      with urgent repairs to housing and infrastructure, as part of its response to
      a review into the Indigenous communities. But the report found that $77.7m was
      needed just to bring dilapidated housing up to a standard that complied with
      the Residential Tenancy Act. Further costs were required to address the identified
      problems, including infrastructure and opportunities to improve governance.
      “Various governments over the years had failed to provide an efficient and effective
      public housing service to Aboriginal people living in town camp communities,”
      the report said. The report found that a combination of ageing houses – the
      majority were more than 20 years old – as well as neglect by tenants and a lack
      of appropriate maintenance meant almost one in five was in “poor condition”
      or worse. The NT government has gsupported most of the recommendations in a
      16,000-page review of town camps but it pushed back against recommendations
      to encourage people to move away from their homes for “economic opportunities”.
      The review assessed more than 700 households, as well as essential services
      and other infrastructure, and service-delivery arrangements. In housing refurbishments
      and rebuilds in Darwin alone, the estimated cost was $15.6m, with a further
      $32.4m for infrastructure maintenance and upgrades to meet current design standards.
      Alice Springs required $34.8m in infrastructure improvements to meet design
      standards and $24.3m for new or improved housing. In Borroloola the cost estimates
      were $36.3m and $14.4m for infrastructure and housing. The cost of maintaining
      and upgrading infrastructure in Katherine’s town camps was set at about $34.4m,
      with $11.2m for housing refurbishments and rebuilds. In Tennant Creek $2.8m
      is needed for infrastructure and $10.5m for housing. There were further costs,
      also in the millions, for other areas including Elliot and Jabiru. The NT government
      called for the federal government to match its $25m investment dollar-for-dollar.
      The territory has 43 town camps, mostly on the outskirts of Alice Springs and
      Darwin. While some have been developed or improved, others have been left to
      degrade, and governments have been accused of abandoning some of Australia’s
      most vulnerable people. The One Mile Dam town camp, bordering the Darwin city
      centre, has had long-running housing problems, with about half the residences
      having no water or electricity, and many of them being little more than fenced
      sheds. Bagot community on the outskirts of Darwin has reported overcrowding
      and social problems. The report recommended against building more homes in the
      camps, which it said would just “perpetuate the current cycle”. Instead it urged
      investment in “sustainable social housing” in regional centres which offer job
      and training opportunities and sustainable services. “By incentivising migration
      to economic centres with robust economies through sustainable social housing
      programs and equipping residents of town camps, who choose to transition, with
      the skills to participate and the means to access employment, over time, we
      can make a real difference,” the report said. In the meantime, housing had to
      be upgraded to meet the standards of the tenancy act, it said. The NT housing
      and community development minister, Gerry McCarthy, said while the government
      supported most of the recommendations it did not back the idea of encouraging
      people to move away from their homes to pursue economic opportunities. “We will
      support residents to stay in their homes and develop a sustainable future for
      town camps,” he said. The NT opposition leader, Gary Higgins, welcomed the review’s
      release but questioned the government’s commitment to improvements, since it
      had received the report in August last year. “I continue to question the Labor
      government’s commitment to truly listen to the concerns of some of the territory’s
      most disadvantaged people, given its ongoing inaction in relation to town camps,”
      he said. The report is the result of an inquiry announced by the previous Country
      Liberal party government in 2016 after complaints from town camp residents and
      the launching of unprecedented legal action by several remote communities. The
      Labor government received the report from Deloitte in August. The firm had been
      given several deadline extensions owing to the complex nature of the inquiry.
      In its introduction it noted this complexity and the impact it and a lack of
      Indigenous involvement in policy development had on Indigenous communities in
      the NT. “Aboriginal people are not an ongoing problem to be resolved, they are
      part of the solution,” it said.

    - 'Peter Dutton’s department blocked a white South African farmer’s asylum bid
      because its evidence showed “the vast majority of crimes against whites are
      not racially motivated”. A delegate for Dutton also shut down a second, separate
      asylum bid by a white South African woman who feared racially motivated persecution,
      arguing there was no evidence she “had been targeted because of her race or
      gender or that she would be targeted for this reason upon her return”. To be
      granted refugee status, an asylum seeker must have a well-founded fear of persecution
      for one or more of a number of legislated reasons: race, religion, nationality,
      membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. The two decisions,
      both made by immigration authorities in 2015, appear to be at odds with Dutton’s
      recent stance in support of protecting white South African farmers. In March
      Dutton said the farmers deserved “special attention” from a “civilised country”
      like Australia on humanitarian grounds. Dutton’s comments followed reporting
      and opinion writing in News Corp newspapers that white farmers in South Africa
      were being targeted, and was backed by Tony Abbott. It sparked a rebuke from
      the South African government and was rejected by the foreign minister, Julie
      Bishop, who noted that Australia’s humanitarian visa program was “non-discriminatory”.
      This week Dutton received a written request from a man in the South African
      community to “fast track” a quota of South Africans. It came amid reports of
      government MPs discussing options to take several thousand in one go, likening
      it to the 12,000 humanitarian visas given to Syrians fleeing the deadly civil
      war. The first decision, which was upheld by the administrative appeals tribunal
      in September last year, involved a white South African farmer who made an asylum
      bid to the immigration department in January 2015, because he “fears harm on
      the basis of his race” should he return home. The man told the immigration department
      he was the victim of a serious attack at his home in 1998, where his wife and
      another five people were murdered, and he was left with serious injuries. The
      claim was corroborated by media reporting. But the immigration department knocked
      back his asylum request in July 2015, arguing there was little evidence of racially
      motivated crime against white farmers or white South Africans. The department’s
      stance was only made public because the farmer appealed the decision to the
      administrative appeals tribunal, which again ruled against the farmer’s application
      for protection. “The delegate of the department in the decision record dated
      [July] 2015 referred to country sources which indicate that although white farmers
      are targeted for crime at a rate higher than other white people in the country,
      there was also significant crime against black farm workers,” the tribunal’s
      decision read. “Furthermore, the department referred to sources which indicate
      that the vast majority of crimes against whites are not racially motivated,
      but rather are crimes for financial gain.” In ruling on the farmer’s appeal,
      the tribunal also downplayed the notion of racially motivated violence against
      white South Africans. It accepted he genuinely feared harm in South Africa,
      and agreed he had experienced “horrific and terrible” crime himself. “However
      the evidence discussed above indicates that the motive of the perpetrators of
      crime is considerably more likely to be based on economic need, and a violent
      subculture, rather than race,” the tribunal ruled. “Sources also indicate that
      there is a general level of violence arising out of criminal activity in South
      Africa, which affects the entire population. “Some groups, such as young black
      men or women in black townships, are affected disproportionately, with one commentator
      stating that people in ‘suburbs can buy security that people in townships cannot’.”
      In the second case, a delegate for Dutton rejected an asylum bid by a white
      South African woman in March 2015 after the woman asked for Australia’s protection.
      The woman was not a farmer but said she and her son would be targeted in South
      Africa “because they are ethnically white South Africans”. Dutton’s delegate
      argued there was no evidence to support her claims of racial persecution. “The
      delegate accepted that the applicant had been the victim of crimes in 2002 and
      2008, but did not accept she had been targeted because of her race or gender
      or that she would be targeted for this reason upon her return,” an appeal judgment
      said. Dutton was contacted for comment but did not respond.'

    - 'Sam Allardyce has told Wayne Rooney to increase his presence in the opposition
      penalty area following clear-the-air talks this week with the former England
      captain. Rooney did not disguise his anger at being substituted during the goalless
      draw with Liverpool last Saturday, when 32-year-old was withdrawn in the 57th
      minute by Allardyce for the second game in succession. The Everton manager,
      who insists he has no problem with Rooney’s reaction, explained that he wanted
      “more legs” in midfield but believes the striker remains better suited to a
      deeper role. Allardyce, however, also wants Rooney to attack more, with the
      team’s leading goalscorer having failed to find the target since the defeat
      of Swansea City on 18 December. “With his experience he should be dropping deeper
      and providing goals but I do think he should get into the box more,” said the
      Everton manager, whose team travel to Swansea on Saturday. “He hasn’t scored
      since Swansea and not scored from open play since Newcastle [13 December] and
      I would like him to get forward a little bit more. Certainly in the games we
      are controlling more and attacking more I would like him further up the pitch
      but he is also one of our best passers. I would like that combination to get
      bigger, certainly from a goalscoring point of view.” Rooney has scored 11 goals
      this season – three from the penalty spot – with Oumar Niasse Everton’s second
      highest scorer with eight. Allardyce added: “We’ve only got Wayne in double
      figures and that’s because of penalties. If you’re going to get into Europe
      you can’t get there without two players getting into double figures – minimum
      – so that’s been a massive struggle this year. We haven’t got anyone who has
      come close to scoring the amount of goals that [Romelu] Lukaku got last year
      and that’s why our defending has to be so much better. It doesn’t need an experienced
      manager like me to work that one out.”'

    - 'Apple reportedly warned employees in an internal memo that it “caught 29 leakers”
      last year and that 12 were arrested, adding that workers who disclose information
      to the media have “everything to lose”. The memo about leaking, which was leaked
      to Bloomberg and published on Friday, threatened employees with criminal consequences
      and shines a harsh light on the Silicon Valley company’s aggressive surveillance
      of its own employees and intensive investigative efforts to catch and punish
      leakers. “Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for leaking
      details from an internal, confidential meeting about Apple’s software roadmap.
      Hundreds of software engineers were in attendance. ... One person betrayed their
      trust,” the company reportedly wrote on its internal blog. “The employee who
      leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did
      it because he thought he wouldn’t be discovered. But people who leak – whether
      they’re Apple employees, contractors or suppliers – do get caught and they’re
      getting caught faster than ever.” The memo further warned workers to be wary
      of “press, analysts and bloggers” who may “target” or “befriend” them on social
      media: “While it may seem flattering to be approached, it’s important to remember
      that you’re getting played … A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate
      massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter
      who broke it. But the Apple employee who leaks has everything to lose.” The
      Guardian could not independently confirm the memo, and the company did not respond
      to a request for comment on Friday. The memo said “leakers in the supply chain”
      were also getting caught, adding: “Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at
      Apple. In some cases, they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion
      and theft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes.” The company did
      not provide details on the dozen arrests that it said took place last year,
      but said those included “employees, contractors and some partners in Apple’s
      supply chain”. The memo added: “These people not only lose their jobs, they
      can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere.” The memo was leaked
      at a time when Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, has been positioning his company as a
      more ethical tech firm compared to others in Silicon Valley. Last month, he
      issued a harsh rebuke of Mark Zuckerberg and the business model at Facebook,
      which is reeling from a major data privacy scandal. A recent Guardian investigation
      uncovered details of the so-called “rat-catching” team at Facebook, which conducts
      surveillance on workers and fired one employee who leaked innocuous information
      to a reporter. Apple is notorious for its culture of secrecy and has reportedly
      made employees sign non-disclosure agreements specific to projects and used
      black cloths to cover unlaunched products.'

      by Russians, comprise the bulk of the 3.4 million holidaymakers expected to
      visit the destination this year. The Cypriot government’s spokesman, Prodromos
      Prodomou, says: We may be closer to Syria than anyone else but Cyprus is not
      involved in what is happening. Nobody has asked to use our airbase in Paphos,
      for example. What the British authorities decide to do on the sovereign bases
      is not within the control of the Republic of Cyprus. They are not obliged to
      give information to us … we have no say in what goes on in them, although –
      unofficially as a matter of courtesy, let’s say – they will often inform us.
      The decision of some commercial airlines to reroute flights after Euro Control’s
      warning was bad publicity, but did not overly affect the island where bookings
      had been pre-paid. “It was a first. Last year there was no such warning,” said
      Prodromou, referring to the tomahawk strike Trump ordered after a previous chemical
      attack in Syria. Over in Cyprus, officials are attempting to kill off speculation
      Russia would retaliate with an attack against British sovereign bases on the
      island in the event of US-led punitive airstrikes inside Syria. Speaking to
      the Guardian, the government spokesman Prodomos Prodromou describes the scenario
      of a counter-attack as “so remote” it borders on being “crazy”. He says: It
      is impossible to imagine a scenario where Russia not only hits Britain [ in
      retaliation] directly but does so in Cyprus,” he said. “It would be crazy to
      have a confrontation between the US and Russia … the scenario of a counter attack
      [staged] in Cyprus is a fantasy, a fiction. Cyprus, an EU member state with
      traditionally good relations with Russia, has found itself caught in the middle
      as debate over missile attacks has mounted. The former colony is host to two
      British sovereign bases, including a vital military installation at RAF Akrotiri,
      where eight typhoon and six tornado fighter bombers are stationed. As Britain’s
      main forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East, RAF Akrotiri’s
      front line role as a launch pad makes it a prime candidate for counter attack,
      analysts say. The Foreign Office says Moscow’s accusation that Britain directed
      the attack on Douma is “ludicrous”. A spokesman says: Russia has wielded its
      UN Security Council veto six times since February 2017 to shield the Assad regime
      from scrutiny for its use of chemical weapons. These accusations from Moscow
      are just the latest in a number of ludicrous allegations from Russia, who have
      also said that no attack ever happened. This simply shows their desperation
      to pin the blame on anyone but their client: the Assad regime. The chemical
      weapons attack in Douma last Saturday was a shocking and barbaric act that cost
      up to 75 lives including young children. British UN ambassador Karen Pierce
      said that Britain was not involved in an alleged deadly chemical weapons attack
      in Syria, rejecting an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry. Pierce told
      reporters: This is grotesque, it is a blatant lie, it is the worst piece of
      fake news we’ve yet seen from the Russian propaganda machine. My colleague Jessica
      Elgot has learned that both Jeremy Corbyn and Vince Cable are receiving security
      briefings on Syria today. United Nations war crimes investigators today condemned
      the suspected use of chemical weapons in the Syrian town of Douma in eastern
      Ghouta and called for evidence to be preserved with a view to future prosecutions.
      International chemical weapons experts were travelling to Syria to investigate
      an alleged gas attack by government forces on Douma which killed dozens of people.
      The UN international commission of inquiry on Syria said in a statement: Perpetrators
      of such attacks must be identified and held accountable. We stress the imperative
      need to preserve evidence, and call upon all relevant authorities to ensure
      no party tampers with suspected sites, objects, witnesses, or victims before
      independent monitors and investigators are able to access the area. French UN
      ambassador Francois Delattre said that the Syrian government’s decision to again
      use chemical weapons meant they had “reached a point of no return” and the world
      must provide a “robust, united and steadfast response”. He told the UN security
      council: In deciding to once again use chemical weapons the regime has reached
      a point of no return. France will shoulder its responsibility to end an intolerable
      threat to our collective security. Yousif Al Bustani, 27, from Douma, Syria,
      had to flee to the Aleppo countryside five days ago following the chemical attack.
      In response to Donald Trump’s threats of military action, told me: I’m like
      a large number of Syrian people who is in support of attacking Assad’s regime
      but not to destroying Syria. This is a criminal regime surrounded by a bunch
      of gangsters, they have killed people and destroyed cities. Attacking Bashar
      has been the demand of the Syrian people for more than five years not just today.
      We want Trump to shell the presidential palace, security sites, army bases and
      militias bases. We do not consider these sites to be part of Syria but part
      of the Russian and Iranian occupation of Syria. I have no problem at all if
      these sites are levelled to the ground, they are the source of all evils. The
      aim of the attack should not be only attacking the regime, it should force Bashar
      to step down and to be summoned before a tribunal for all his massacres against
      the Syrian people, of which some are documented and many others are not. Frankly
      speaking, I have no confidence in any state especially the US administration,
      which only takes care of its own interests. The Americans themselves have helped
      in lengthening the suffering of the Syrian people for more than seven years
      now by not arming the Syrian rebels with anti air missiles rockets. They did
      not do anything to protect the Syrian people and at the same time, they did
      not allow the Syrian people to protect themselves. The Syrian people are used
      now by the Americans as a means of pressure on the Russians. I have no problem
      with any state in the world who wants to help in toppling the regime though
      it is difficult to predict what the Americans can do. US ambassador to the United
      Nations Nikki Haley said that Washington estimates that Syrian president Bashar
      al-Assad’s forces have used chemical weapons at least 50 times during the seven-year-long
      conflict. She told the UN security council: Our President has not yet made a
      decision about possible action in Syria. But should the United States and our
      allies decide to act in Syria, it will be in defense of a principle on which
      we all agree. All nations and all people will be harmed if we allow Assad to
      normalize the use of chemical weapons. Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia
      has told the UN Security Council that the United States, France and Britain
      are only interested in ousting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s government
      and containing Russia. He said: We continue to observe dangerous military preparations
      for an illegal act of force against a sovereign state in what would constitute
      a breach of international law. We call on the leadership of these states to
      immediately reconsider. The sole thing they have an interest in is to oust the
      Syrian government and more broadly to contain the Russian Federation. United
      Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, addressing the Security Council
      on Syria, urged all states “to act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances.”
      He told the 15-member council: Increasing tensions and the inability to reach
      a compromise in the establishment of an accountability mechanism threaten to
      lead to a full-blown military escalation. Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle has
      written a thread on Twitter arguing that joining a US strike would be “folly”
      and that Britain should pursue humanitarian and diplomatic support while also
      “suspending sales of arms and chemical weapon precursors”. He points out that
      Britain approved export licences to Syria for the sale of chemicals between
      2004 and 2012. He adds: I have sympathy with the desire to act; to try and enforce
      both international law and to show Syria that it cannot continue to poison its
      citizens. But there is no way to bomb Syria into the country we want it to be.
      RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus is at the sharp end of the British military presence
      in the eastern Mediterranean. Rumour is rife on the island that the installation
      would be targeted if Russia were to retaliate in the event of US-led military
      action in Syria. At last count, Britain’s main forward mounting base for overseas
      operations in the Middle East had eight typhoon and six tornado fighter bombers
      ready for action. Here’s what we know so far: Russian foreign minister, Sergei
      Lavrov, claimed Moscow had “irrefutable” evidence that the suspected chemical
      weapons attack in Syria was staged with the help of a foreign secret service.
      He did not provide evidence for the claim. Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander
      Yakovenko, said the UK-funded White Helmets were behind fake reports about the
      incident. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for more dialogue with
      Russia in in a phone call with his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin. “The president
      of the republic called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained and stepped
      up to bring peace and stability back to Syria,” a statement from Macron’s office
      said. Russia tested the use of door handles as a way of delivering nerve agents
      and targeted the email accounts of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, according
      to previously classified intelligence over the Salisbury attack. Ambassador
      Yakovenko has demanded proof that Yulia Skripal is alive and well. He announced
      that Russia is lodging an official challenge to the way the UK investigated
      the incident and claimed evidence was being destroyed. He denied Russia had
      produce or stored novichok or tracked the Skripals but said he not seen the
      UK’s latest dossier. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government
      of “waiting for instructions” from Donald Trump adding that military intervention
      risks “escalating an already devastating conflict”. He also called for a UN-led
      investigation of the chemical weapons attack in Douma. There are growing calls
      for the government to give MPs a vote before launching any military intervention
      in Syria. Labour is actively exploring ways to bring a debate on any military
      action to parliament, but will have difficulty forcing a Commons vote. Donald
      Trump has been tweeting today but so far not about Syria. The target for his
      insults today is the former FBI director James Comey. Ambassador Yakovenko says
      Russia was not tracking Sergei Skripal in the UK. “We want to know what happened
      in this country, because Russia was blamed. We want to know the truth,” he said.
      If Yulia Skripal claims political asylum in the UK that’s a decision for her,
      he said. “We want to hear her story. We want to have a fully-fledged investigation.
      Theresa May has said Russia was behind this. We want to see the evidence,” Yakovenko
      said. “We didn’t produce novichok. We never had it. We never stored it in the
      army,” Yakovenko added. He added that Russia will send an official request today
      to the UK challenging its inspection into the Salisbury incident. Yakovenko
      says he is not aware of any conversations between Putin and Trump since last
      week’s suspected chemical attack. But he confirms that Putin has not spoken
      to Theresa May about the incident. Asked more about the claim the Douma attack
      was staged, Yakovenko denies he was implying British special forces were involved
      in such an operation. He says the White Helmets were responsible for the “fake”
      report. On UK claims that Russia had been spying on the Skripals for five year,
      Yakovenko chuckles. “They always complain when something goes wrong,” he said.
      Yakovenko is also about the UK’s claim that Russia tested nerve agent on door
      handles before the Skripal attack. He said the UK has not shared those concerns
      with Russia. “I didn’t see this, because I was preparing for this press conference,”
      he said. On Salisbury Yakovenko disputes the UK claim that the OPCW backed the
      UK’s analysis of the poisoning. The OPCW never confirmed where the nerve agent
      involved was manufactured. “The report is saying nothing about that,” he said.
      “All the statements made by Boris Johnson and other people are not correct,”
      he said. “The report never supported the British version,” he said. Asked why
      Russia is backing a suspected war criminal in Syria, Yakovenko says Assad was
      democratically elected and the only legitimate leader in Syria. On Russia’s
      veto of a UN investigation into the Douma attack, he said the US were proposing
      an old way of investigating which would not have involved visiting the site
      of the suspected attack. The planned OPCW inspection is “exactly what we wanted”,
      Yakovenko said. Yakovenko says Russia will publish its own report into the Salisbury
      nerve agent attack. He says Russia is currently studying the OPCW full unpublished
      report into the incident. He refuses to say whether the “quite thick” full OPCW
      report mentions the nerve agent novichok. The British side are not transparent,
      Yakovenko claims and suggests the UK is flouting international law over the
      investigation into the poisoning. Yakovenko demands “proof” that Yulia Skripal
      is safe. He questions why there have been no photographs of the Skripals or
      interviews with them since the incident. “What is happening in this country,
      if the press is supposed to be free?” he asks. Yakovenko claims the UK-funded
      White Helmets are “famous for staging attacks” in Syria. French President Emmanuel
      Macron has raised concerns about the deterioration of the situation in Syria
      in a phone call with his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin. He also called for
      more dialogue with Moscow, his office said. Macron, who claims France has proof
      the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in an attack last week, also expressed
      regret at Russia’s use of its United Nations Security Council veto on the attack.
      “The president of the republic called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained
      and stepped up to bring peace and stability back to Syria,” a statement from
      Macron’s office said. Yakovenko pointed out, at his continuing press conference
      in London, that France has provided no evidence of proof that Syria was behind
      the Douma attack. Yakovenko taunted western allies considering military action
      by playing clips of Tony Blair before and after Iraq war. In a statement, the
      embassy said: “The infamous aggression against Iraq in 2003 immediately comes
      to mind, when the then Prime Minister Tony Blair deliberately misinformed the
      Parliament and the public. It is well known how it ended – with Chilcot inquiry
      delivering a condemnatory verdict.” On Syria, Yakovenko says Russia has been
      warning for weeks of the possibility of a staged chemical attack by Syrian rebels.
      He alleges that the Western-backed White Helmets could have been behind staging
      the incident. He welcomes the fact-finding mission by the OPCW which is due
      to start tomorrow. He claims any delay could be used by the west to deliver
      military strikes to destroy evidence. Yakovenko accuses the UK and France of
      “mechanically” following America’s lead on Syria. Russia’s UK ambassador Alexander
      Yakovenko is giving a press conference in London. He complains that the UK has
      refused consular access to Yulia Skripal after she was discharged from hospital.
      He claims the UK government is deliberately destroying all evidence on the Salisbury
      incident. He claims a letter to Boris Johnson about the Skripals has remained
      unanswered. Russia tested the use of door handles as a way of delivering nerve
      agents and targeted the email accounts of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia
      since at least 2013, according to previously classified intelligence over the
      Salisbury attack made public by the UK on Friday. The UK is making public previously
      classified intelligence linking Russia to the attack on the Russian double-agent,
      including claims that Moscow had tested the use of door handles as a way of
      delivering nerve agents and that Russian military intelligence had targeted
      the email accounts of both victims since at least 2013. The claims were made
      in a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s national security adviser, to the
      Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. It is extremely rare for the UK to
      make such intelligence public. In the letter, Sedwill, who has an overview of
      the work of all the UK spy services, filled in some of the intelligence that
      Theresa May referred to when she made a House of Commons statement saying Russia
      was “highly likely” to have been behind the attack. In that news conference
      Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed Moscow had “irrefutable” evidence
      that the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria was staged with the help
      of a foreign secret service, AFP reports. “We have irrefutable evidence that
      this was another staged event, and that the secret services of a certain state
      that is now at the forefront of a Russophobic campaign was involved in this
      staged event,” he said during a press conference. He did not provide evidence
      for the claim. According to Syrian medics and a statement by the World Health
      Organisation, more than 40 people died in an 7 April strike on the former rebel
      outpost of Douma of symptoms consistent with the use of chemical weapons. The
      US and its allies believe the Syrian regime was behind the attack, but Russia
      has long insisted it was staged by rebels in an attempt to provoke further Western
      intervention. Russia’s embassy in the UK says it concerned by reports that the
      cabinet has agreed to take action against Syria. In a statement it said any
      airstrikes could hamper the OPCW’s investigation into the possible use of chemical
      weapons in Douma. It said: “At the request of the Syrian Government the OPCW
      sent a fact-finding team to Douma. The experts will arrive tomorrow. Syrian
      authorities will provide all the relevant security guarantees. Russia is ready
      to assist in ensuring its safety. We are interested in seeing independent experts
      there, so they can make all the necessary tests without delay. The conditions
      on the ground, now that the Russian military police is present in Douma, are
      appropriate for conducting investigation of the alleged incident. Russian services
      for chemical and radiological security visited the suspected site of the incident
      and did not find any traces of chemical substances. No persons treated for chemical
      poisoning were found in local hospitals ... UK statements in favour of an independent
      investigation clearly contradict those automatically laying the blame on the
      Syrian government. Military strikes may be used to cover up all the evidence,
      or lack thereof, on the ground. Such a decision, if it’s taken, in violation
      of the international law and the Charter of the United Nations may well mark
      the latest in the series of the reckless military adventures by the UK ... It’s
      essential to avoid any steps which could escalate the tensions. Donald Trump
      and Theresa May last night discussed the need for a joint response to Syria’s
      use of chemical weapons, according to Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to London.
      In a tweet Johnson suggested that any US-led action in Syria would be coordinated
      with the UK. Isamael Abdulla, a 31-year-old resident of western Aleppo, says
      he is constantly monitoring Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. I’m waiting for his
      most powerful tweet yet in which declares war against Bashar Al-Assad. The problem
      with the Syrian crisis is the international community’s hesitation. It has refused
      to halt the killing machine of the Syrian regime and its deadly supporters in
      Russia and Iran. I’m worried that his tweets are merely negotiating tactics.
      We are fed up of US red lines that turned to be traffic light warnings. Maybe
      Trump is waiting for other powers to back his decision, but last time when he
      attacked Shayrat with 60 missile, he did not wait for any international endorsement.
      The US administration and the UN only get upset only when there is a chemical
      attack, as if other sorts of weapons used to kill people are alright. This daily
      killing should be stopped as soon as possible. The only solution for the Syrian
      problem is a unified world repsonse to disband the foreign support to Bashar
      and back the Syrian people who have become refugees all over the world. I support
      an attack that can change the Syrian regime without causing great loss among
      civilians. If Bashar stays in power, we will witness more massacres in the future.
      Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he hoped that there would
      be no repeat of the experience of Libya and Iraq in the Syria conflict. “God
      forbid anything adventurous will be done in Syria following the Libyan and Iraqi
      experience,” Lavrov told a news conference on Friday, Reuters reports. He said
      that even the smallest miscalculation in Syria could lead to new waves of migrants
      and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. Russia and the United
      States are using their channels of communications on Syria, according to the
      minister. Lavrov also questioned the UK claims that the OPCW report into the
      Salisbury poisoning confirmed its analysis of the incident. He said this was
      an “overstated” interpretation of the OPCW’s report. The Labour leader has asked
      for a security briefing - on privy council terms - on Syria, but it is understood
      no response has been received from Number 10. Labour are also actively exploring
      ways to bring a debate on any military action to parliament, but will have difficulty
      forcing a Commons vote. The party does not have any scheduled opposition debates
      next week. It could potentially force an SO24 emergency topical debate - a technical
      procedure which would allow the House to vote on whether there should be a vote
      to authorise military action. But the vote would not be binding on the government,
      which has shown over the past six months it is minded to abstain and effectively
      ignore opposition motions. Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova
      has told Sky News it will protect its people on the ground in Syria if missiles
      are launched by the US and its allies. She said: “Russia should protect its
      people on the ground, of course. We came to Syria at the invitation of the people.
      You can see their appreciation on the ground.” Zakharova also criticised Donald
      Trump warning in a tweet that Russia should “get ready” because missiles “will
      be coming, new and new and ‘smart’”. She said: “I was surprised that such strong
      messages were sent through social media because this should be a time to phone
      your partner ... We can resolve all these problems by picking up the phone,
      not by force.” Bassam Abu Abdullah, an advisor to Syrian Ministry of Information,
      has again denied that the Syrian army attacked civilians with chemical weapon.
      Speaking to BBC News he said: “We didn’t use and we will not use any kind of
      chemical weapons because we don’t have these kind of chemical weapons after
      2013. We joined the international agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons.”
      Abdullah claimed videos appearing to show the aftermath of the suspected attack
      on Douma were “fabricated”. He said: “The source of these films said that 10
      people died and 600 were injured. Where are these people? Can you show us them?
      What are their names? Nothing.” “We are ready to receive the investigators from
      the OPCW and show them anything they want. We have nothing to cover.” On the
      threat of US-led military strikes he said: “We are not ready to give any opportunity
      for the US, France or Britain to attack us. We are defending ourselves. We are
      not attacking British interests. We are not a threat to the national security
      of the US or France or Britain. This is our right to defend our state. We are
      combatting terrorists, we are not combatting democratic people. Who left Eastern
      Gouta? They are terrorists from Jaish al-Islam the Wahhabi movement.” Thousands
      of Islamist fighters and their relatives left Douma as the last evacuations
      from Eastern Ghouta continued, AFP reports citing the UK-based Syrian Observatory
      for Human Rights (SOHR). The fighters from the Jaish al-Islam group left overnight
      with thousands of civilians on board 85 buses that took them to areas of northern
      Syria still held by rebels. The evacuations are part of a deal brokered by Damascus’s
      Russian ally to re-establish regime control on Eastern Ghouta, a area just on
      the edge of the capital that had escaped government control since 2012. “After
      midnight, 85 buses left Eastern Ghouta carrying 4,000 people, both fighters
      and civilians,” the SOHR. “Over the past few days, most of the Jaish al-Islam
      fighters have left Douma in four successive waves,” the Britain-based monitor’s
      head, Rami Abdel Rahman, said. The group was the last in the erstwhile besieged
      Ghouta enclave to resist the exit proposed by Russia but an alleged chemical
      attack by the regime on 7 April appeared to break their will. The government
      has consistently denied the attack and a delegation of experts from the OPCW
      chemical watchdog arrived in Damascus to investigate. They are expected to start
      their work on Saturday. “The evacuation operation should wrap up before the
      OPCW experts enter Douma,” Abdel Rahman said. Russia’s deputy prime minister
      Arkady Dvorkovich has said international relations should not depend on the
      mood of one person when he wakes up in the morning, according Russian news agency
      reports cited by Reuters. In an early-morning tweet on Wednesday, Trump warned
      that missiles “will be coming” in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack
      by Syrian government forces. Russia is Syria’s most important military ally
      in the country’s civil war. “We cannot depend on the mood of someone on the
      other side of the ocean when he wakes up, on what a specific person takes into
      his head in the morning,” Dvorkovich said at a forum in Krasnoyarsk, according
      to the Tass news agency. “We cannot take such risks.” In another tweet on Thursday,
      Trump appeared to cast doubt on at least the timing of any US-led military action.
      “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or
      not so soon at all!” it said. Trump usually starts tweeting in the next hour
      or so. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah does not believe the latest Syria crisis
      will spiral into a wider war, its deputy leader has said, Reuters reports. The
      heavily armed Shia Hezbollah movement has been a vital military ally of Syrian
      President Bashar al-Assad in the seven-year war. “We rule out the situation
      developing into a direct American-Russian clash or a wide state of war,” Sheikh
      Naim Qassem told Lebanese daily al-Joumhouria in an interview. “The conditions
      do not point to a total war happening ... unless (U.S. President Donald) Trump
      and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu completely lose their minds,”
      he said. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogăn has warned Russia and the US
      against treating the Syrian conflict as a proxy war. “No one has the right to
      engulf the Mediterranean and the Syrian lands in the fire of their political
      and military power struggles,” he said at speech in Ankara. Erdogăn has discussed
      his concerns about Syria in separate phone calls with both Donald Trump and
      Vladimir Putin in the last 48 hours. In his speech he said: “We are extremely
      uncomfortable about the fact that some countries who have confidence on their
      military power are using Syria as their arm-wrestling field.” He claimed that
      the international community had used the fight against Islamic state (or Daesh)
      to support Kurdish separatists. He said: “We see even a single terrorist, whether
      it be from Daesh or PYD (the Kurdish Democratic Union Party) or under any other
      name, along our borders as a threat to us and consider it a condition for our
      survival to do what is necessary.” “Our relations with Russia, Iran and China
      are complementary to our relations with the West, not an alternative. Yet, this
      is not an obstacle to us expressing the wrongs of the two sides in other fields.
      Those who support the murderous Assad regime are wrong. Those who support the
      PYD terror are wrong. We will fight against both of these wrongs to the end.”
      France’s foreign ministry has produced a video, translated into English, setting
      out why it thinks France has a duty to react to the use of chemical weapons
      in Syria. It also repeats President Emmanuel Macron’s claim in a TV interview
      on Thursday that France has proof that the Assad regime used chemical weapons
      in Douma. Such simple and short videos, tailored for social media, are all the
      rage in modern diplomacy. Here’s the Foreign Office’s take on the OPCW’s report
      into the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.
      The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War has been tracking reports
      of military movements of Russia and Syria since last weekend’s chemical attack
      on Douma. It has this summary: Two Russian Su-24M ‘Fencer’ attack aircraft conducted
      several low-altitude passes in close proximity to the USS Donald Cook and the
      French frigate Aquitaine in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea on April 11. The Russian
      Navy conducted a firing drilloff the Syrian coast in a likely attempt to deter
      U.S. and allied naval maneuvers near Syria on April 11. Russia reportedly deployed
      four Tu-95MS ‘Bear’ and Tu-160M ‘Blackjack’ strategic bombers as well as an
      unspecified number of Il-78M tanker aircraft from the Engels Air Base in Southern
      Russia. Their final destination is unknown although they may be bound for Syria
      or theHamedan Air Basein Western Iran. Russia previously targeted locations
      in Eastern Syria from the Engels Air Base. Russian and regime forces enhanced
      the air defenses around Syria’s capital, Damascus, where the regime conducted
      its chemical weapons attack on April 7. Pro-regime forces deployed short- to
      medium-range surface-to-air missiles, including six Russian Pantsir-S2s, to
      theMezzeh Military Air Baseand other sites in Damascus. Pro-regime officials
      also reportedly issued an alert to the Syrian Arab Army to evacuate personnel
      and assets from military bases across Syria. Regime and Russian aircraft relocatedcloser
      to heavily-defended commercial airfields across Syria. Aircraft relocated from
      the Seen (Sayqal), Dumayr, Shayrat, and the T-4 (Tiyas) Air Bases to the Bassel
      al Assad International Airport in Latakia Province, the Nayrab Air Base outside
      Aleppo City, and the Damascus International Airport. Iranian proxies, including
      Lebanese Hezbollah, reportedly began exiting Syria. Hezbollah reportedly relocated
      a number of fighters from Syria into Lebanon. Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies
      reportedly also entered Iraq from positions along the Syria-Iraq border, including
      Abu Kamal in Eastern Syria. Unspecified pro-regime elements reportedly evacuated
      a branch of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) in Jamraya
      near Damascus. The SSRC is a Syrian government body responsible for research
      and development on advanced weapons systems, including ballistic missiles and
      chemical weapons. Russia’s Black Sea fleet is in closer proximity to the Syrian
      coast than US forces amid reports that the fleet has been on a heightened level
      of alert since at least mid-March, writes Peter Beaumont. The shadow home secretary,
      Diane Abbott, has struggled to defend Labour’s call for a UN-led inspection
      into the Douma attack. Asked on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether Labour
      would back intervention if the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons
      confirms chemical weapons had been used she said: “Let’s see what the inspectors
      come up with. Even in the US there is an understanding that we don’t have all
      the evidence.” When it was pointed out that Russia had repeatedly vetoed calls
      for a UN-led investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Abbott
      said: “There has to be a political negotiation. We would press on trying to
      bring people to the table. We believe more bombing is not the answer to the
      crisis in Syria.” “There is a response which falls short of more bombing. We
      believe there needs to be a coordinated international drive to achieve a ceasefire
      and a negotiated political settlement.” Asked about the circumstances in which
      Labour would support military action, Abbott cited the Second World War. But
      she repeatedly refused to say what circumstances she would back military action
      now. “There is no evidence to show that further bombing in Syria will make the
      region more stable,” she said. She was also asked which country posed the biggest
      threat to world peace: Russia or the US. After trying to avoid the question
      she eventually said: “It is clear that at this point Russia, its role in Syria,
      what we believe beyond reasonable doubt its role in the poison gas attack in
      Salisbury, is a greater threat to world peace than the United States.” A split
      in the shadow cabinet over military action in Syria has emerged. Shadow International
      Development Secretary Kate Osamor told the House magazine that “intervention
      must take place” if the UN concludes the Syrian government was behind the alleged
      atrocity. Politics Home reports her saying: “If a leader is killing their own
      they need to be removed. We don’t keep them there. They need to go. He needs
      to be removed. “Intervention must take place if evidence comes back that the
      PM or the president or whoever the leader is, is gassing his own people. Get
      them out. “If a leader is killing their own they need to be removed. We don’t
      keep them there. They need to go. He needs to be removed.” “But I suppose what
      we’ve seen is it’s not as easy as that. And I think that’s where Jeremy’s position
      comes from. It’s not as easy as just removing someone.” Update: Osamar has since
      clarified her remarks to claim she is not advocating military action in Syria.
      There are growing calls for the government to give parliament a vote before
      launching any military intervention in Syria. A Downing Street statement issued
      after Thursday’s cabinet meeting made no reference to whether MPs should be
      given a say. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Ian Blackford, leader
      of the SNP in Westminster have both urged May to give MPs a vote. Ken Clarke,
      former chancellor and father of the House of Commons, said parliament should
      be recalled this weekend. “You don’t just waive aside accountability to parliament
      because it is inconvenient. Saturday or Sunday you could sit,” he told the BBC.
      In a letter to May, SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said: I am not convinced
      that the retaliatory airstrikes being proposed by the United States is a proper
      way forward. Though should the UK government wish to participate then it must
      only do so if the UK parliament gives its consent. This is a view shared by
      a cross-party group of MPs who have signed EDM 92 to that effect, and a number
      of your own colleagues who have put forward this view in the media these past
      few days. Despite Donald Trump’s slightly more circumspect rhetoric over Syria
      on Thursday it is hard to escape the drum beat for military intervention. The
      Times claims the largest US air and naval strike force since the 2003 Iraq war
      is heading towards Syria. Last night the UK cabinet unanimously backed Theresa
      May’s warning that Syria’s use of chemical weapons could not go unchallenged,
      leaving the way open for British participation in military action. Downing Street
      said senior ministers had agreed it was highly likely the Syrian government
      was responsible for the “shocking and barbaric” gas attack on the rebel-held
      town of Douma, which killed up to 75 people. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has
      accused the government of “waiting for instructions” from Donald Trump adding
      that military intervention risks “escalating an already devastating conflict”.
      In a statement issue early on Friday morning he called for a UN-led investigation
      of the chemical weapons attack in Douma. Corbyn added: “Further UK military
      intervention in Syria’s appalling multi-sided war risks escalating an already
      devastating conflict. “The Government appears to be waiting for instructions
      from President Donald Trump on how to proceed. But the US administration is
      giving alarmingly contradictory signals. “Even US defence secretary James Mattis
      has said we ‘don’t have evidence’ and warned further military action could ‘escalate
      out of control’.” Meanwhile, Russia has been granted a request for the United
      Nations Security Council to meet on Friday for fresh discussions on the threat
      to international peace from air strikes on Syria. And a team from the Organisation
      for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is due to start its investigation in
      Syria on Saturday. On Friday campaigners from the Stop the War Coalition will
      hand in a letter signed by MPs, trade unionists, celebrities and academics to
      Downing Street urging May to not take military action in Syria.'

    - 'Tesla had a clear message to DeWitt Lambert, a black employee alleging racial
      discrimination: take our money and stay quiet. “In terms of settlement, we are
      willing to pay Mr. Lambert [redacted], but only if we are to resolve this matter
      before there is media attention, preferably within the next few hours,” the
      Tesla general counsel, Todd Maron, wrote to the worker’s lawyers last year.
      “If there is media attention first, there will be no deal.” The message, which
      a lawyer shared with the Guardian this week, provides a stark illustration of
      what some say is Tesla’s aggressive legal and media strategy in the face of
      serious complaints and potential negative press. The controversial PR tactics
      of Elon Musk’s car company have been on full display this week as the corporation
      has worked to publicly blame the victim of a fatal crash involving its autonomous
      technology. In the three weeks since the death of Walter Huang, 38, whose Tesla
      Model X crashed while in Autopilot mode in California, the company has repeatedly
      argued that the victim was at fault, not its nascent technology, and it has
      openly feuded with US investigators about the release of information. The defensive
      statements amid the current tragedy and the settlement offer in Lambert’s labor
      dispute provide a window into the way Musk’s firm has tried to silence critics
      – or publicly attack them. It’s a familiar approach in Silicon Valley, where
      companies work to block bad publicity by keeping complaints out of court and
      resolving high-profile disputes behind closed doors. But some say the tactics
      are particularly intense at Tesla, a firm that often receives fawning coverage
      from the tech press surrounding Musk’s ambitious projects and celebrity status.
      Lambert, an electrician hired as a production associate in 2015, alleged in
      a harassment, retaliation and discrimination lawsuit that he was subject to
      “repeated racist epithets for months”, including “violent” rhetoric and attacks
      using the N-word. Last year, Tesla emphatically denied the claims in lengthy
      statements that sought to cast doubts on Lambert’s character and alleged that
      his lawyer was engaged in a “media blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous
      narrative”. Lambert’s attorney, Larry Organ, who has faced repeated criticisms
      from Tesla surrounding his civil rights litigation, shared the attorney’s settlement
      email with the Guardian as an example of the corporation’s efforts to stop bad
      press and silence workers with complaints. The March 2017 email from Maron said
      if Lambert rejected the settlement and spoke out, “we will of course point out
      all of the facts in the attached document”. The document, according to Organ,
      attacked Lambert’s character. Organ further said Tesla had offered to have Musk
      meet Lambert as part of a settlement. “Tesla is a big corporation, and they
      feel like they can bully people,” Organ said in an interview. “And shut them
      up with money,” added Navruz Avloni, another attorney representing Lambert.
      A Tesla spokesperson did not deny the contents of the email, but alleged that
      Maron was responding to a “breathtaking” demand for money and threat to go public
      with a story. The company initially refused to provide a statement, but after
      publication of this story, a spokesperson said in an email: “The characterization
      of this email exchange is misleading.” He added that Organ’s “demand” was “beyond
      extreme and totally unwarranted given the facts of the case, and amounted to
      extortion, so our general counsel instead proposed a resolution that would actually
      be fair”. Organ told the Guardian the offer they discussed was just under $1m:
      “It seems to me they put a fairly low value on stealing a man’s dignity.” There
      are numerous examples of highly combative PR and legal strategies by Tesla in
      the wake of scandal. This week, attorneys for Huang’s family alleged that Tesla’s
      Autopilot feature was “defective” and “likely caused Huang’s death” when the
      car collided into a median. Tesla, however, said it was Huang’s fault: “The
      crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead,
      which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang
      was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings
      to do so.” Tesla’s statement expressed condolences to the relatives, who gave
      a television interview about their grief. But the company also said: “The reason
      that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.”
      On Thursday, Tesla also went after the National Transportation Safety Board
      (NTSB), a US agency that accused the company of improperly releasing information
      about the crash investigation. “It’s been clear in our conversations with the
      NTSB that they’re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting
      safety,” Tesla said in a statement announcing it would make an “official complaint
      to Congress”. Tesla has previously attacked the media in response to reporting
      on discrimination claims. After a female engineer shared her allegations of
      harassment with the Guardian, Tesla issued lengthy statements criticizing the
      woman and ultimately fired her, accusing her of pursuing a “miscarriage of justice”.
      Tesla has also vehemently denied her underlying claims. Musk has also been personally
      defensive about claims that his factory is unsafe for workers. After the first
      fatal crash involving Autopilot in 2016 – when Tesla’s technology did not prevent
      a car from colliding with a large white truck – the company defended its product.
      The family of that victim, Joshua Brown, eventually released a statement that
      said “Joshua loved his Tesla” and that the car was not at fault. Paul Grieco,
      an attorney for Brown family, said this week he couldn’t comment on whether
      Tesla paid money or had relatives sign any kind of confidentiality agreement.
      Tesla also declined to comment. “The parties were able to resolve their disputes
      amicably,” Grieco said, later adding: “I cannot comment on any of the settlement
      terms.”'

    - 'Comparisons with Liverpool’s illustrious past have often irked Jürgen Klopp
      as he endeavours to illuminate the future and demands that his players write
      their own history. He will make an exception for a showpiece European occasion
      with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. Tommy Smith’s bullet-header, Bruce Grobbelaar’s
      spaghetti legs and Alan Kennedy’s penalty will all form part of the Liverpool
      manager’s revision for what he hopes will be a Champions League semi-final shaped
      by destiny. Liverpool’s visit to the Italian capital for the semi-final second
      leg on 2 May will be Klopp’s first appearance at Stadio Olimpico. His club and
      their supporters will require no introduction. Two of Liverpool’s five European
      Cup triumphs were secured in Rome, against Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1977
      and Roma in 1984, and Klopp will revisit both finals before meeting Eusebio
      Di Francesco’s team. The football fan in the German came to the fore as, for
      once, he looked back. “I will watch the two finals for sure because it is destiny
      or whatever,” Klopp said. “If any German goes to Bern in Switzerland he cannot
      avoid thinking about 1954 [the World Cup final comeback against Hungary]. There
      are not a lot of people around on the planet from that time now but it is just
      a special place. You think: ‘OK, it happened here, well done, all these guys.’
      That is how it is, but it was too long ago. If I find something that helped
      make this place even more remarkable or special for Liverpool then I will use
      it. Thank God Rome is still Rome. It is the place, it is not who did what, it’s
      the place.” Klopp is not averse to Liverpool history lessons; it is the weight
      he feels it places on the club’s current players that he does not like. Having
      defeated Manchester City 5-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals he senses that
      weight may be lifting. “I love our history but it is not allowed to compare
      us constantly,” he says. “You can do whatever you want but it is not allowed
      for us. Those teams were great but they became great in these situations and
      now people say, ‘They did it like this.’ “I had a very famous German national
      player who was the coach of a second division team when I was in the second
      division. He did a shooting session and the boys were kind of my level so not
      too good. This guy took the ball and scored five times and said: ‘Look it is
      not that difficult.’ The boys were standing around and thinking now we know
      you can do it but we still have no clue. It is good to have role models but
      in the end you have to do it your own way.” Liverpool are gathering momentum
      as the season enters its defining period. Klopp, who insists victory over Bournemouth
      on Saturday should be the club’s sole focus when seeking a top-four finish,
      claims belief is also soaring among players, fans and Anfield legends, having
      reached the last four of the Champions League. He added: “It’s nice being in
      the semi-finals. Like I said before Manchester City, write our own history.
      You only judge history when you watch it back and I am really happy we are in
      a situation where we are focused on this group. The legends we all love are
      around and they are clapping because they like this. Kenny Dalglish is over
      the moon and completely on fire. Steven Gerrard and all the other guys in between,
      you can feel it and see it. That’s cool. “It’s normal when you go to a semi-final,
      especially after a long time and you hear the numbers – Bayern six times in
      a row, semi-final; Madrid eight. Then Roma and us. That’s nice but in the end
      it’s a nice sign that we are so far so good. “The City game showed it but we
      have space to improve. Yes, in a few moments we can be at a really high level
      and we have a few things that make us an uncomfortable opponent and the other
      team has to think: ‘We better not do that’. “Think of the second half against
      City. They knew it because of the last situation in the first half because of
      one ball. It would have been nice for Ox [Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] to score
      but it was important because the boys in that moment felt like they had been
      under fire for 500 minutes and then you almost put them out with the big chance.
      That is how our development is the whole season. “When they work they get more
      confident and now it’s a case of attitude, character, staying greedy and wanting
      to do the next step. That’s why it is important we are now fully focused on
      Bournemouth. Everything is positive, talk so much about positive things and
      as human beings when you constantly hear you are fantastic it is the first step
      to not being fantastic any more. We have to stay this kind of angry. “We have
      so much to go for and it will never stop because even if the season finishes
      there will be space for improvement and working from that is the plan. The relationship
      between us and the supporters, in terms of the sense of belief from both sides,
      has reached the next level and that’s all credit to the boys.”'

    - 'When addressing the subject of Saturday’s fixture with Manchester City, the
      word most commonly used by Mauricio Pochettino was massive. A massive gap to
      the top, a massive three points and a massive opportunity. It is also these
      massive matches, according to the Tottenham manager, that bring out the best
      in Dele Alli. The England international turned 22 on Wednesday and celebrated
      by performing the Floss, a viral dance, on Instagram and attending a Peaky Blinders-themed
      party. Of greater interest to his coach, and his upcoming opponents, will be
      the statistics that show Alli has made a greater attacking contribution to his
      team than Cristiano Ronaldo did at the same age. During a season when Alli has
      been under constant scrutiny, Pochettino called the midfielder “the best 21-year-old
      in the world”. Now, as a 22-year-old, his manager explained why Alli’s talent
      was “not something you can buy at the market”. “For me it’s a massive challenge
      to play Manchester City,” he said. “[For Alli] he needs a strong opposition
      to give his best. It’s his character. He is so competitive that when it’s easy
      he’s not interested. In training sessions, when you do finishing practice without
      any opposition, sometimes you have to say: ‘Dele, come on.’ But if you put opposition
      there, he will score an unbelievable goal. “He is a bit special. Not just a
      special talent but a special character. That is why we are talking a lot during
      the whole season about Dele Alli because he is a special talent with special
      energy. He needs to feel the competition.” Alli elaborated on his manager’s
      thoughts, explaining why he benefits from playing against the top teams. Alli
      has scored nine of his 36 league goals for Spurs against the other top-six clubs,
      five of those in matches with Chelsea, including two at Stamford Bridge last
      month. His current tally against Manchester City is two. “When you play in the
      Premier League against the top six, as opposed to bottom-half teams, the game
      is always a lot different,” Alli said after last Saturday’s fixture with Stoke.
      “The top six really go at it with you. Both teams want to win and there’s a
      lot more space. Both teams are looking to attack. “Teams in the bottom half,
      they still have a lot of qualities and they can hurt you at any time, but they’re
      more likely to sit off and close the gaps in between the lines so it’s a lot
      more difficult for a No 10 to get on the ball and create chances.” As for City,
      Alli believes there will be opportunities against them. “Man City are an amazing
      team, they’ve been very good this year, but we want to win every game and we
      fancy ourselves against anyone,” he said. “Of course [an attacking approach]
      can work. They’re only human, they can make mistakes. They’re an incredible
      team with incredible players all over the pitch, but we’re going to try to play
      our football as we always do.”'

    - 'Antonio Conte admitted he has made mistakes this season but should Chelsea
      fail to catch the top four, the responsibility for an error-strewn campaign
      would also involve his players and the club’s hierarchy. The ailing champions
      go into their game at Southampton on Saturday 10 points behind Liverpool and
      Tottenham, and with only three league wins secured from their 11 top-flight
      fixtures since the turn of the year. They have won only once since late October
      – against Manchester United on Bonfire night – when confronting a side then
      in the top half of the table, with form having dipped alarmingly. That has prompted
      tensions within the set-up and fuelled the belief Conte will depart Stamford
      Bridge in the summer. “It’s difficult now to explain the reasons why we’re struggling
      in this way this season,” Conte said. “There are many reasons. But now’s not
      the place or moment to speak about this. The only thing we can do is try to
      finish in the best possible way. For sure, we made a lot of mistakes this season.
      When I talk about a lot of mistakes, I involve me, my staff, the players and
      the club. For sure, we must reflect at the end of the season. “If we don’t qualify
      for the Champions League, it means we have to divide the fault, also with the
      players. We must be ready to share the responsibility. I’m the first to take
      my responsibility. Then there is the club. Then there is the players. In football,
      but in every job, it’s right to be in this way. We must be frustrated. Me, my
      staff, the players and the club, for this season. You start the season with
      great expectations. Instead we have struggled a lot, for many reasons.” Asked
      to elaborate on what mistakes he had made, Conte added: “When you have this
      type of season you have to share this responsibility, not only the boss. I’m
      the coach of this team. I’m the first person to take my responsibility. But,
      for sure, I’m not alone. Now is not the right moment to discuss this. For us,
      the most important thing is to be focused on the present. Then there is the
      club who, for sure, are working for the future. “Everyone has to find in himself
      the right desire, the right will to fight. There are six games to go and we
      have a semi-final in the FA Cup. A possibility then to play in the final for
      the second year in a row. I know my players. I trust them. I like to think that
      everyone is giving everything of themselves.”'

    - 'Perhaps it was inevitable Sam Tomkins would have the last laugh here. In the
      moments leading up to kick-off, Tomkins was ridiculed by the Leeds supporters
      after slipping while attempting a warm-up conversion attempt. In true Tomkins
      fashion, it still sailed through the posts. Tomkins has plenty of previous with
      Leeds, of course – seven years ago he was in the thick of the headlines when
      Wigan beat the Rhinos in the Challenge Cup final – but how he and Wigan will
      have savoured this moment more than most. Wins in Leeds do not come easily for
      Wigan, who had not won here since 2012. And, just as he has been so many times
      before, Tomkins was at the heart of this latest performance, though the question
      remains as to how many more he will be involved in beyond this season. Speculation
      continues to link the 29-year-old with a move to Catalans in 2019; the general
      consensus is that the deal is already done. “Whatever happens, we’ll deal with
      it,” was Shaun Wane’s response when asked about Tomkins’ future: but on nights
      like these, it is clear to see why Wigan would want to keep him. And a remarkable
      ending – in which Wigan overturned an eight-point deficit in the final nine
      minutes to win courtesy of Tomkins’ game-wining drop goal – at least managed
      to somewhat overshadow a game which is highly unlikely to make it to the end-of-season
      highlights package. For over an hour, both sides toiled amidst a litany of penalties
      and handling errors; it was far from the ideal advert for Super League in a
      game featuring the competition’s last two champions. And when Leeds went eight
      points ahead with 16 minutes remaining, the smart money was on them leapfrogging
      Wigan into second. But, in their coach’s own enigmatic way, he summed up their
      collapse well. “We stuck our heads up our backside and didn’t pull them out,”
      Brian McDermott said. “We started playing crazy and we changed the way we played.”
      Leeds scored the only try of a largely forgettable and frustrating first half,
      after a fine Richie Myler pass found Tom Briscoe unmarked. It was a rare moment
      of quality, with the next points not coming until after the hour mark when Watkins
      kicked Leeds into a two-score lead. Wigan’s performance to that point was epitomised
      by Tomkins, whose effort and endeavour was underlined by unforced errors, but
      he would ultimately have the final say. He played a part in the move which allowed
      Oliver Gildart to score with nine minutes remaining, and after he kicked the
      conversion, he followed suit with a penalty before kicking the drop goal which
      won the game with three minutes left. Leeds Golding; Briscoe, Watkins, Handley,

    - 'Theresa May has made a strident argument to her cabinet ministers that Britain
      should not allow the creeping erosion of the taboo of using chemical weapons
      that been an international norm since the first world war, the Guardian understands.
      Downing Street said there is still no precise timetable for further military
      action, most likely to commence over the weekend, but the prime minister is
      understood to have argued in her opening address to cabinet that any British
      action in Syria should be limited to precise targeting of chemical weapons facilities
      and distribution. May told her cabinet, which was recalled on Thursday to discuss
      next steps in the international response to the Douma chemical attack, that
      the UK’s intention was not regime change or prolonged involvement in the Syrian
      civil war. The prime minister has previously said her administration considers
      it highly likely Syrian forces were behind the atrocity. Speaking to ministers,
      she said the UK had long striven to uphold the international norm that the use
      of chemical weapons was abhorrent, but in recent years that norm had been eroded,
      citing a pattern of behaviour from the Assad regime in Syria. That norm must
      be restored, she said. A government source said the prevention of the normalisation
      of chemical weapons was the whole rationale behind May’s decision that Britain
      should join any international response. Any agreed military response would be
      focused on that, the source said. May spoke to the French president, Emmanuel
      Macron, late on Friday night, after speaking to Donald Trump overnight on Thursday.
      Earlier on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn also accused May’s government of “waiting for
      instructions” from the US on how to proceed in the Syrian crisis, but said Trump
      was giving “alarmingly contradictory signals”. The Labour leader and his Liberal
      Democrat counterpart, Vince Cable, received a security briefing from the government
      on Friday afternoon. Corbyn has insisted he wanted to see the evidence of who
      was behind the apparent chemical weapons attack in the town outside Damascus,
      which has killed more than 40 people. “I want to know who did it. If there is
      proof the regime did it, they must be held responsible. If there’s a proof anybody
      else did it, they must be held responsible,” he said in an interview with Sky
      News. “I would say very strongly to Russia and the US: ‘Stop blocking each other’s
      resolutions’.” Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to block
      resolutions on Syria, including one on Tuesday that would have established an
      independent investigation into the suspected use of chemical weapons. Corbyn
      denied that it was pointless, given Russia’s record, to continue to call for
      UN investigations. “Anything that brings a cessation of the use of chemical
      weapons moves us nearer, if not totally, to a ceasefire and a reopening of the
      Geneva talks which has got to be the right way forward.” The prime minister
      is likely to face severe criticism from opposition MPs and members of her own
      party if she does not give MPs a vote in parliament on extending UK military
      action in Syria, but appears to be prepared to face down any condemnation if
      allies decide to act over the weekend. Any further delay would put intense pressure
      on May to hold a vote in parliament, which returns from recess on Monday. If
      the government does not offer a debate, both Labour and the Scottish National
      party are planning to demand that the Speaker, John Bercow, grants one on Tuesday.
      Though Downing Street says no decision has been taken about the sequence of
      events, it will be argued that under royal prerogative May is not required to
      seek the permission of MPs, and under the convention that emerged after the
      Iraq war, she may also act alone in some circumstances, including to preserve
      the operational security but also to prevent humanitarian catastrophe. The former
      attorney general Dominic Grieve has said there was no legal basis for a punitive
      raid to deter the Syrian regime from repeating what he called its “flagrant
      breach” of the international convention banning chemical weapons – except under
      the doctrine of humanitarian necessity. That is the UN convention on the responsibility
      to protect, agreed in 2005, which was the basis of David Cameron’s unsuccessful
      appeal to parliament over Syrian intervention in 2013. A team of inspectors
      from the international chemical weapons watchdog is due to start an investigation
      on Saturday into the attack in Douma.'

    - 'Relations between the west and Russia have deteriorated sharply amid concerns
      about a US-led military strike in the Middle East, prompting the United Nations
      secretary general to declare “the cold war is back with a vengeance”. Adding
      to tensions on an extraordinary day of tit-for-tat exchanges, the UK published
      previously classified intelligence making fresh claims about the nerve agent
      attack in Salisbury, including that Russia had tested whether nerve agents could
      be applied to door handles. Military planners in the US, Britain and France,
      awaiting a final decision from their respective governments, are preparing plans
      for airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack
      by the Russian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad. Although anxious to avoid
      hitting Russian planes and military personnel based in Syria, the danger is
      of miscalculation and Russian retaliation. António Guterres, seemingly alarmed
      by the speed of events, told an emergency meeting of the UN security council
      that the current volatility could have profound ramifications in the Middle
      East and beyond. The UN secretary general suggested the danger was even greater
      than during the cold war because the safeguards that existed then to manage
      such a crisis “no longer seem to be present”. He added that there was no military
      solution to the Syrian conflict. On a day of rapid developments that underscored
      the rationale behind Guterres’ comments: The UK published previously classified
      intelligence claiming Russian military intelligence had targeted the email accounts
      of Sergei and Yulia Skripal since 2013 and had tested whether door handles could
      be used to deliver nerve agents. It said the highest concentration of the nerve
      agent found in Salisbury had been on the door handle. The Russian ambassador
      to the UK said it would produce its own dossier setting out an alternative version
      of what had happened in Salisbury. The Russian defence minister, Maj Gen Igor
      Konashenkov, claimed to have direct evidence that Britain had orchestrated the
      alleged chemical attack at Douma in Syria. The UK, he said, was “directly involved
      in the provocation”. Although the US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said no
      decision has yet been taken on military action, the US, UK and France were building
      up military resources in the eastern Mediterranean. The fresh claims about the
      Salisbury attack were made in a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s national
      security adviser, to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. It is extremely
      rare for the UK to make such intelligence public. The decision to go public
      was prompted by the UK coming off second best over the last few weeks in the
      war of words with Russia over responsibility for the attack. The surprise move
      by the intelligence agencies, who usually jealously guard their information,
      escalates tensions with Russia. In his letter, Sedwill, who has an overview
      of the work of all the British spy services, said: “I know that Nato will remain
      seized of the need to confront the increasingly aggressive pattern of Russian
      behaviour of which the attack in Salisbury was an acute and recent example.”
      His letter filled in some of the intelligence that Theresa May referred to when
      she made a House of Commons statement saying Russia was “highly likely to have
      been behind the attack. In response, the Russian ambassador in London, Alexander
      Yakovenko, who seemed to be caught on the hop by the Sedwill letter, announced
      that the embassy would be publishing its own report on the attack. “The British
      government still hasn’t produced any evidence in support of its position that
      would confirm their official version,” he told a press conference, at which
      he showed footage of Tony Blair apologising for intelligence mistakes made in
      the run-up to the Iraq war. “We get the impression the British government is
      deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence.” In his
      Nato letter, Sedwill said the nerve agent novichok had been developed at the
      Russian research facility in Shikhany as part of an offensive chemical weapons
      programme with the codename Foliant. Sedwill said Russia regarded at least some
      of its defectors as “legitimate targets for assassination”, with the suggestion
      that they could include Skripal, a former member of the GRU, Russian military
      intelligence, who was convicted by Russia of espionage in 2004 after working
      for MI6. “We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest
      in the Skripals, dating back at least as far as 2013, when email accounts belonging
      to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,” Sedwill wrote. “During
      the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical
      warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these
      weapons. This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering
      nerve agents, including by application to door handles. Within the last decade,
      Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same
      programme.” He said Russia had continued developing small amounts of novichok
      over the past decade. “Russia’s chemical weapons programme continued after the
      collapse of the Soviet Union,” he added. “By 1993, when Russia signed the chemical
      weapons convention (CWC), it is likely that some novichoks had passed acceptance
      testing, allowing their use by the Russian military. “Russia’s CWC declaration
      failed to report any work on novichoks. Russia further developed some novichoks
      after ratifying the convention. In the mid-2000s, President [Vladimir] Putin
      was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme. It is highly
      unlikely that any former Soviet republic (other than Russia) pursued an offensive
      chemical weapons programme after independence. It is unlikely that novichoks
      could be made and deployed by non-state actors (eg a criminal or terrorist group).”
      The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is linked to
      the United Nations, confirmed on Thursday that a novichok nerve agent had been
      used in the Salisbury attack. Sedwill wrote: “I would like to share with you
      andallies further information regarding our assessment that it is highly likely
      that the Russian state was responsible for the Salisbury attack. Only Russia
      has the technical means, operational experience and the motive.” The failure
      of the UK to release intelligence had left a vacuum that Russia had filled with
      various alternative explanations and scenarios for the attack. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon,
      a British chemical weapons expert, said he was delighted some of the intelligence
      had finally been made public, expressing regret it had not been done earlier.
      “I think we had been losing the information battle and we had to get on the
      front foot,” he said.'

    - 'For most of us the word “tornado” conjures up images of vast “twisters”, like
      the one that ripped through the US state of Kansas and whisked away Dorothy
      and her dog Toto in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. But “Tornado Alley” is not
      the only place where tornadoes occur. They are also common across Europe, and
      although not as large as their American cousins, they are still dangerous and
      damaging. During the last 200 years Europe has suffered three tornadoes with
      death tolls of over 50 people: Ivanovo in Russia in June 1984 (69 fatalities),
      Oria in Italy in September 1897 (55 fatalities) and Montville in France in August
      1845 (at least 70 fatalities). Meanwhile, in June 1967, six tornadoes spun their
      way across France, Belgium and the Netherlands, resulting in 232 injuries, 15
      deaths and serious damage or destruction of just under 1,000 houses. So what
      would happen if this outbreak occurred today? New research published in the
      journal Weather, Climate and Society, reveals that we could expect as many as
      170 fatalities, up to 2,500 injuries, and serious damage to 25,000 buildings.
      Although not common, scientists warn that an outbreak like this should be expected
      somewhere in Europe within the next 50 years. •Kate Ravilious will be one of

    - 'Donald Trump has issued a full pardon to I Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the former
      chief of staff to vice-president Dick Cheney under George W Bush. Libby was
      convicted in 2007 of obstruction of justice and perjury, in connection with
      an investigation into the leak of the identity of a CIA agent, Valerie Plame.
      His conviction was the result of an investigation by special counsel Patrick
      Fitzgerald, who was appointed by the then deputy attorney general, James Comey.
      President Bush commuted Libby’s sentence, sparing him jail time but leaving
      him a convicted felon who had to pay a fine and do community service. Trump’s
      pardon totally expunges the conviction. In a statement, the president said:
      “I don’t know Mr Libby but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly.
      Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.”
      White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters: “The president thought
      it was the right thing to do.” A spokesman for Bush said: “President Bush is
      very pleased for Scooter and his family.” Sign up to receive the top US stories
      every morning In his own statement, Libby said: “My family and I are immensely
      grateful to President Trump for his gracious decision to grant a pardon. For
      over a dozen years we have suffered under the weight of a terrible injustice.”
      Plame, whose identity was made public after her husband, Joseph Wilson, wrote
      an op ed critical of part of the Bush administration’s justification for the
      Iraq war, said it was “simply false” that Libby had been treated unfairly. She
      added: “If a person does not tell the truth, particularly if he serves in government
      and holds the public trust, he must be held accountable. President Trump’s pardon
      is not based on the truth.” Recent reports that a Trump lawyer inquired about
      pardoning power prompted controversy in Washington. The inquiries were reportedly
      made in relation to the former Trump aides Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort,
      the former having pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and the latter pleading
      not guilty on financial charges arising from the Mueller investigation into
      Russian election interference. Trump has reportedly considered firing Robert
      Mueller, the special counsel appointed after Comey was fired as FBI director
      last May. Talking to reporters on the way into the White House on Friday morning,
      Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said: “Many people think that Scooter Libby was
      a victim of a special counsel gone amok.” In a statement, House Democratic leader
      Nancy Pelosi said: “President Trump’s pardon of Scooter Libby makes clear his
      contempt for the rule of law. “This pardon sends a troubling signal to the president’s
      allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded. The suggestion that those
      who lie under oath may be rewarded with pardons poses a threat to the integrity
      of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy.” A White House statement
      said: “Before his conviction, Mr Libby had rendered more than a decade of honorable
      service to the nation as a public servant at the Department of State, the Department
      of Defense, and the White House. His record since his conviction is similarly
      unblemished, and he continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and
      peers.” Libby said: “Many good and noble Americans have told me that, having
      seen how I was treated, they would never go into public service. No one understands
      their misgivings more than I do. Perhaps one day public service in America will
      prove less of a blood sport. Until then, we are all fortunate that there are
      those who will enter the arena for their love of our country and our freedoms.”
      Libby is the third person pardoned by Trump. He has pardoned former sheriff
      Joe Arpaio, a Trump supporter convicted for violating a federal court order
      to stop racial profiling against Latinos, and Kristian Saucier, a sailor who
      took photos in a classified area of a submarine. Saucier’s case was often compared
      by Trump and other Republicans to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server
      while serving as secretary of state. Libby’s case is discussed in A Higher Loyalty,
      the book by Comey which was obtained by the Guardian and other outlets on Thursday
      ahead of publication next week, prompting an angry Twitter outburst from Trump
      in which he called Comey “a proven LEAKER &amp; LIAR” and “an untruthful slime
      ball”. Comey writes that the Libby case was “one of my early experiences in
      Washington of people deciding motivations based on their partisan allegiance.
      To Democrats, it was obvious members of a Republican administration were subverting
      justice to undermine and punish their critics. To Republicans, it was just as
      obvious that this was a witch-hunt against people who made an inconsequential
      mistake.” On Friday, there was disagreement within Bush-era Republican circles.
      Liz Cheney, the former vice-president’s daughter and now a US representative
      for Wyoming, wrote on Twitter: “Scooter Libby is a good, honorable and innocent
      man who was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct and a miscarriage of justice.
      Thank you [Donald Trump] for righting a terrible wrong and delivering the full
      pardon Scooter deserved.” But Matthew Dowd, an ABC political analyst who was
      chief strategist on Bush’s re-election campaign in 2004, wrote: “This pardon
      of Scooter Libby is simply outrageous. “I worked for President Bush from 1999
      to 2005, and Scooter is a felon whom President Bush would not even pardon. He
      was convicted of obstruction of justice, lying, and perjury. This is a dark
      day for the rule of law in America.”'

    - 'The US has said it has proof that the Syrian regime carried out a chemical
      weapon attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Saturday, rejecting a Russian
      claim that it had been staged by British intelligence. Both the White House
      and state department announced on Friday that the US had “a high level of confidence”
      about the regime’s culpability for the use of poisonous gas in Douma. The declaration
      marked a shift from a statement by the defence secretary, James Mattis, on Thursday,
      that the US was still looking at the evidence. But the US envoy to the UN, Nikki
      Haley, told the security council that the Trump administration had still not
      decided on a military response. The UK denounced as “a blatant lie” Russian
      claims that the country’s intelligence services were responsible for staging
      “the fake chemical weapons attack” in Douma, as a pretext for launching a wider
      military assault on the Syrian regime forces. Moscow had previously said there
      was no traces of any chemical attack in Douma. Inspectors from the Organisation
      for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are due to visit the scene on
      Saturday. However, France, UK and the US have said their own evidence already
      points to Damascus. Western diplomats would not rule out military action while
      the OPCW is on the ground, but said their capitals would try to avoid a situation
      in which inspectors could be vulnerable to harm or being taken hostage. Asked
      about the Russian accusation against the UK, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah
      Sanders said: “Our intelligence tells us otherwise ... We have a very high confidence
      that Syria was responsible”. The state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert,
      said: “We can say that the Syrian government was behind this attack... We know
      there are only certain countries, like Syria, that have delivery mechanisms
      and have those types of weapons.” Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister,
      said he had obtained documentary evidence showing that “special services of
      a country, which is now seeking to be in the first ranks of the Russophobic
      campaign, were involved in this staged event”. The UK Foreign Office said the
      claims were preposterous. Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to London,
      told reporters the UK-funded Syrian civil defence forces, the White Helmets,
      were responsible for staging fake chemical attacks by the Syrian army in an
      attempt to mislead the world. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defence ministry spokesman,
      went further saying: “We have … evidence that proves Britain was directly involved
      in organising this provocation.” He said Russia had proof that London put pressure
      on the White Helmets to stage the attack. The White Helmets is a humanitarian
      organisation made up of 3,400 volunteers who rescue civilians from the rubble
      after airstrikes. Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to the UN, described the
      claims as “grotesque, bizarre and a blatant lie”. She added: “I want to state
      categorically … that Britain has no involvement and would never have any involvement
      in the use of a chemical weapon.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Russia
      has wielded its UN security council veto six times since February 2017 to shield
      the Assad regime from scrutiny for its use of chemical weapons. These accusations
      from Moscow are just the latest in a number of ludicrous allegations from Russia,
      who have also said that no attack ever happened. The allegations plunged the
      two countries’ intelligence agencies into yet more conflict, and came as the
      first members of a UN weapons inspectors fact-finding mission arrived in Damascus
      to see whether evidence remained to prove a chemical weapons attack had occurred,
      as photographs, blood samples and accounts from witnesses have shown. The inspectors
      are expected to be given access to Douma on Saturday. António Guterres, the
      UN secretary general, insisted the inspectors from the OPCW must be given full
      and unfettered access to witnesses and buildings. Russia, in conjunction with
      the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar-al Assad, is in charge of the Douma
      area. At another highly charged session of the UN security council on Friday,
      Russia’s Vassily Nebenzia repeated the claim that the attack was staged. Hayley,
      his US counterpart, said she was “in awe” that Nebenzia could make such claims
      “with a straight face”. Pressed outside the UN chamber on when the US would
      decide whether to launch a military strike, Haley said: “You don’t rush decisions
      like this.” She added that if there was haste, “you make a mistake”. On Thursday
      Trump called Theresa May, the UK prime minister, and the two agreed “it was
      vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged”. But the US
      delay in taking action appears to be caused by divisions between the White House
      and Jim Mattis, the US defence secretary, on the viable targets that could be
      struck in an effort to wipe out Syria’s alleged chemical weapons stores and
      factories. The hesitation in Washington gave Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish
      president, a chance to consult with Vladimir Putin to see whether they can construct
      a compromise that will avoid a military attack but still satisfy western demands
      that Russia stops protecting Assad’s breaches of the chemical weapons conventions.
      Macron, who on Thursday said he had proof of use of chemical weapons by Syrian
      regime – also called for dialogue with Russia. But the glimmer of hope for diplomacy
      came alongside continued planning for a military assault. Britain’s military
      chiefs have been working on a range of scenarios over the last few days. The
      focuss of an attack would be on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons research and
      storage facilities. Other targets under consideration by the Ministry of Defence,
      working in coordination with the US and France, include Syrian command and control
      centres as well as airbases, planes and helicopters. An attack on Assad’s presidential
      palace in the hills above Damascus has been ruled out as a step too far. May
      will be challenged by MPs to spell out her military plans on Monday, if no weekend
      assault has been launched. The planners are anxious to avoid destroying Russian
      equipment or killing Russian personnel based in Syria, potentially provoking
      a reaction from Moscow. They insist missiles and intelligence are better than
      in the 1991 Iraq war in which the Amiriyah bomb shelter was hit killing more
      than 400 civilians, or the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in
      1999. A spokesperson for the French defence ministry, chiming with MoD partners,
      said Macron had specified there would be no targeting of Russians in Syria and
      the focus would be on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons capabilities. A prime
      target is the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, west of Damascus, which
      the US has claimed has been involved in the preparation of chemical weapons.
      Targets could include airbases where the chemical weapons are alleged to have
      been stored, as well as aircraft which have allegedly been used attacks. Hamish
      de Bretton-Gordon, an expert who led the UK and Nato chemical weapons response
      teams, said it was highly unlikely that an attack on Syrian chemical facilities
      risked spreading the poison. “The best way to destroy chemical weapons is to
      blow them up,” he said.'

    - 'Leading human rights groups have criticised a government review of the laws
      surrounding unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller camps for reinforcing prejudice
      against nomadic communities. Last week the housing minister, Dominic Raab, announced
      a consultation on the powers available to local authorities, the police and
      landowners to deal with Gypsies and Travellers who settle on land without permission.
      The announcement came following calls by MPs in October for increased eviction
      powers. In a letter to Raab, organisations including Liberty, the Race Equality
      Foundation and the British Institute of Human Rights criticised the government
      for failing to focus on the root cause of the problem – the shortage of sites
      provided by local authorities for Gypsies and Travellers. The letter’s signatories,
      which also include leading Gypsy and Traveller groups, expressed concern that
      the review and the questions chosen to guide the consultation process would
      “reinforce and further anti-Gypsyism sweeping across Europe”. They said increased
      eviction powers could worsen health and educational inequalities for Gypsies
      and Travellers, which are already among the worst for any group in the UK. According
      to figures from July 2017, there are 1,524 caravans on unauthorised camps –
      a rise of 17% on the same month the previous year. In recent months, local newspapers
      across the country have run regular stories about groups of Travellers moving
      caravans on to playing fields or car parks, enraging locals. A report in December
      by the charity Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT), which coordinated the
      letter, found there had been only a 2% increase in socially rented pitches between
      2010 and 2017, which they said was not enough to accommodate the natural growth
      of nomadic communities in the UK. Concerns have been raised that many of the
      sites that do exist are overcrowded and unsafe. Tensions between Travellers
      and nearby communities have come to the fore in recent weeks after the death
      of Henry Vincent, who was fatally stabbed during an altercation after he broke
      into the home of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks. The 37-year-old reportedly
      belonged to the Traveller community near Hither Green, south-east London. Flowers
      and cards laid in tribute to Vincent outside Osborn-Brooks’ house have been
      repeatedly torn down and replaced. One resident shouted: “These are scumbags,
      scumbags, scumbags. We’ve had enough in this country of scumbags,” as he demolished
      the shrine. In a statement last week announcing his consultation, Raab said:
      “The vast majority of the travelling community are decent and law-abiding people.
      But we are particularly concerned about illegal Traveller encampments, and some
      of the antisocial behaviour they can give rise to. We must promote a tolerant
      society and make sure there are legal sites available for Travellers, but equally,
      the rule of law must be applied to everyone.” Gypsy and Traveller bodies have
      argued that there is already enough legislation to tackle anti-social behaviour
      from any person, whether they are in the travelling or settled communities.
      Michelle Gavin, the projects manager at FFT, said the government announcement
      had chosen to focus on anti-social behaviour by a small number of people rather
      than “local authorities’ nationwide failure to identify land for Traveller sites”.
      “The vast majority of Gypsies and Travellers who are living on unauthorised
      land are not doing this because they want to,” she said. “Would you want to
      live in a public space with next to no privacy? Would you want to get regularly
      evicted? Would you want to be the subject of press articles about ‘Traveller
      invasions’?” She added: “It is a disgrace that in 2018, so many Gypsy and Traveller
      families cannot access a site to live on and therefore cannot access basic water
      and sanitation and often experience uninterrupted access to education and healthcare.”
      Jim Davis, the manager of the equality and social unit at the Traveller Movement,
      said the language used in the announcement was “criminalising the vulnerable”.
      “Raab talks about illegal encampments and the undertone of that is that this
      is criminal activity,” he said. “It’s not a criminal activity. These people
      are homeless. If you had people sleeping in a doorway would you call them an
      illegal sleeper? Of course you wouldn’t.” “If it was any other community, they
      would call this racist” Abiline McShane, a 51-year-old Romany Gypsy living in
      Birmingham, used to make her living running a bouncy castle at fairs across
      the country during the summer, and selling rugs in winter. That changed in 2012
      when her then-six-year-old daughter Leyla Grace fell from a 12ft landing on
      to a concrete floor and fractured her skull. As Birmingham city council couldn’t
      provide her with a site to put her trailer on, she set up an unauthorised encampment
      close to a hospital to focus on getting treatment for her daughter’s brain injury.
      She was evicted from the site after a year and given a council house in the
      Yardley Wood area, with a drive to put her trailer on. “That’s not my home,”
      she says, sitting at the table in her caravan and pointing to the house. “This
      is my home.” McShane expected to be in the house for only six months before
      finding a bay for her trailer in a council-run camp, but five years later she
      is still there. “We’re not asking for special treatment. They give people council
      houses. Why can’t they just give us a space on a camp? It’s cheaper to build
      a space on a camp than it is to build a council house.” She was furious to read
      about the government consultation on unauthorised encampments. “If it was any
      other community then they would call this racist, but because it’s us, no one
      even bats an eyelid,” she says. She says has had abuse shouted at her and stones
      thrown at her windows, and that if more camps aren’t built, community tensions
      will only get worse. McShane says her ancestors left India in the 1500s and
      that her family has been in the UK for hundreds of years. “We are the original
      migrants,” she says. “We’re still compromising our way of life by living on
      camps. If we had it our way, we’d be living by streams and under trees. But
      they won’t even give us the camps.”'

    - The Greens have launched an inquiry into the failed Batman byelection campaign
      to find those responsible for “backgrounding and leaking of sensitive and confidential
      party matters”. The leaked terms of reference for the review, seen by Guardian
      Australia, appear to assume that damaging leaks accusing the Greens candidate,
      Alex Bhathal, of bullying constituted a breach of confidentiality and widen
      the investigation to members’ public discussions of the issue. The 101-page
      internal complaint by 18 party volunteers that emerged during the campaign alleged
      that Bhathal had engaged in misconduct including “systematic intimidation, and
      malicious and reckless false statements about members and party decisions”.
      Bhathal denied the allegations. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has suggested
      that those responsible for the leak should be expelled from the party, describing
      it as a “major factor” in the loss. The review’s terms of reference promise
      to investigate “tension in the Darebin branch” and the “overall risks” to the
      Greens arising from the loss. It will investigate how confidential information
      is provided to the state executive and “the impacts the breaches of confidentiality
      had on the candidate, other individuals, Darebin branch, Batman byelection results
      and [the Australian Greens Victorian branch] as a whole”. In a sign the leaks
      will be blamed for the loss, the review will consider “the interplay between
      internal party matters and the political strategy and electoral results”. Also
      up for investigation is “public messaging” regarding the party dispute and whether
      members’ comments on social media constituted breaches of the code of conduct.
      The review, which will report by 24 May, will “aid party leaders and decision
      makers instigate any recommended actions on members, processes or party structures”.
      In March the former Greens Western Australia convener Grahame Bowland warned
      that the review could constitute a “purge” that would not be limited to people
      responsible for the alleged leaks in Batman. Bowland called on Di Natale to
      resign, saying it was “manifestly unhelpful” that he had prejudiced the outcome
      of internal investigations. On Friday, the Greens Victoria co-conveners Rose
      Read and Colin Jacobs wrote to members acknowledging that many were “concerned
      with how an ongoing conflict in the Darebin branch has become so public in recent
      weeks”. They said the Batman byelection had been “marred by an unfortunate leak”
      and that in recent days “further leaks and damaging allegations have been aired
      by people within and outside the party”. Read and Jacobs promised to investigate
      and “find a way forward to defuse some of the tensions”. The pair encouraged
      members to “be sceptical of what they hear in the media or via third parties,
      to trust in party processes and give fellow members the benefit of the doubt”.
      “Significant damage has been done to the reputations of longstanding Greens
      members without the benefit of any proper, transparent and just process.” They
      urged the Greens not to abuse or harass fellow members, including by “further
      spreading possibly unfounded allegations”. Fairfax Media had reported this month
      that the 18 members responsible for the complaint survived a push to expel them
      from the party at a branch meeting.

    - Donald Trump and his family business tried on Friday to stop the US justice
      department from viewing communications between them and their attorney Michael
      Cohen that were seized by the FBI as part of a criminal inquiry into Cohen.
      Trump joined an effort by Cohen to assert attorney-client privilege over records
      covering Cohen’s representation of Trump over the past decade, setting up another
      extraordinary conflict between the president and his own justice department.
      Meanwhile the Trump Organization, which Trump led until entering office last
      year, claimed to prosecutors that “each and every communication” involving Cohen
      and their executives should also be considered privileged. The Trump interventions
      came as federal prosecutors in New York confirmed Cohen “is being investigated
      for criminal conduct that largely centers on his personal business dealings”.
      Cohen’s office, home, hotel room, electronic devices and safe deposit box were
      searched on Monday by FBI agents who seized records and data. Prosecutors also
      revealed in a court filing on Friday that Cohen’s emails had secretly been searched,
      and that the raids were part of “a monthslong investigation” involving a grand
      jury. FBI agents are believed to have taken documents relating to a payoff to
      Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actor known as Stormy Daniels, who alleged
      she had a sexual encounter with Trump. Records relating to Cohen’s business
      interests, including his ownership of several taxi firms, are also thought to
      have been seized. Attorneys for Cohen filed a request at Manhattan federal court
      for a restraining order which would prevent prosecutors from accessing the seized
      documents until disagreements over what should be sealed are settled. Cohen’s
      attorneys argued at a hearing on Friday morning that they should be allowed
      to review the documents themselves. As a “fall-back option”, they propose that
      the judge appoint a special master to review them. “We think we deserve to know
      some of the findings from this ongoing investigation,” said Todd Harrison, an
      attorney for Cohen. A new attorney for Trump appeared unexpectedly at the hearing
      and argued that the president should be involved in ensuring that his his own
      communications with Cohen are shielded from investigators. “As a privilege holder,
      he has an acute interest in these proceedings and in the manner that these materials
      are reviewed,” the attorney, Joanna Hendon said at the federal court in Manhattan.
      Thomas McKay, an assistant US attorney, argued in the court filing that Cohen
      and the Trump Organization had made “inaccurate and/or overbroad” claims of
      privilege that should be rejected. McKay argued that a so-called “Filter Team”
      from the justice department should be allowed to check all the seized documents
      for possible privilege. Interactions between attorneys and their clients are
      typically kept secret, but an exception can be made if the documents contain
      evidence of criminal activity. Hendon persuaded Judge Kimba Wood to delay until
      Monday arguments over the restraining order that would temporarily ban authorities
      from inspecting the records. “He is the president of the United States. These
      interests are so weighty I think we need more than an afternoon’s adjournment,”
      Hendon said, after Wood proposed that the court take only a short break and
      reconvene later on Friday. “This is of most concern to him,” said Hendon. “I
      think the public is a close second. I think anyone who has hired a lawyer is
      a close third.” McKay, the prosecutor, told the court that Trump had been “on
      notice about this search since Monday” and had waited until the last moment
      to intervene. “With respect, his attorney-client privilege is no stronger than
      anyone who seeks legal advice,” said McKay. Michael Avenatti, an attorney for
      Daniels, was also present in court on Friday and asked the judge to involve
      him in the discussions on who should have access to the documents seized from
      Cohen. “We have every reason to believe that some of the documents relate to
      my client,” said Avenatti. Much of Friday’s hearing focused on arguments from
      the media that hearings on the dispute should not be heard in secret. Wood said
      she had been intending to protect the identities of “innocent people” whose
      information was scooped up in the raids. Wood was nominated by Bill Clinton
      to be US attorney general in 1993 before withdrawing after it was discovered
      that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a babysitter. An attorney for
      ABC News argued that authorities could use pseudonyms to protect identities.
      Lawyers for the New York Times submitted a letter to the judge asking that the
      press be allowed to object to any arguments in the case taking place privately.
      Attorneys for Cohen have requested to have the entire proceedings sealed and
      kept private. Hendon said Trump was entitled to have a say in order to ensure
      the “appearance of fairness”. Hendon said that “given the interest at stake
      and the exceptional nature of my client” it was important for everyone that
      the process be done “scrupulously, so that it is not subject to taint complaints
      later, and so that it withstands scrutiny for all time”. “The privilege belongs
      to the privilege holder, not the lawyer,” said Hendon. “The client can waive
      the privilege, the lawyer cannot.”

    - 'The man who shot and killed six men at a Canadian mosque told police that his
      attack was motivated by Justin Trudeau’s message of welcome to refugees following
      Donald Trump’s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Alexandre Bissonnette
      pleaded guilty last month to six charges of first degree murder and now faces
      up to 150 years in prison for the attack in which 19 other people were injured.
      In video footage of his police interrogation shown during a sentence hearing
      on Friday, Bissonnette told officers that he had grown increasingly preoccupied
      by the the threat of terrorism. But the former social sciences student said
      the final motivation for his attack was Trudeau’s response to Trump’s travel
      ban, when he became convinced his family would be threatened if more refugees
      came to Canada. “I was, like, sure that they were going to come and kill my
      parents also, and my family,” he said. A day after Trump’s travel ban unleashed
      chaos and uncertainty at airports across the US and the world, Trudeau made
      international headlines with a series of tweets highlighting the contrast with
      his own government’s stance. “To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war,
      Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength
      #WelcomeToCanada,” he tweeted on January 29, 2017. The following day, Canada
      announced it would offer temporary residence to those left stranded by Trump’s
      ban. “I was watching TV and I learned that the Canadian government was going
      to take more refugees who couldn’t go to the United States, and they were coming
      here,” Bissonnette told police. “I saw that and I, like, lost my mind. I don’t
      want us to become like Europe. I don’t want them to kill my parents, my family,”
      he said. “I had to do something, I couldn’t do nothing. It was something that
      tortured me.” Bissonnette said that he became obsessed with the 2014 attack
      in which an Islamist gunman killed a soldier at the national war memorial and
      then stormed parliament, and the 2016 truck attack that killed 86 people in
      the French resort city of Nice. He also told police he had struggled with depression,
      and hoped medication would quell his anxiety. “I haven’t felt well for months
      and months and months and I don’t know what to do,” he told the officer during
      the interrogation. He had previously researched the Quebec City Islamic cultural
      center online and knew its prayer schedule when he drove to it on 29 January
      2017, armed with a rifle and handgun. More than 50 people were at the mosque
      when the shooting began during evening prayers. The attack, which lasted less
      than three minutes, killed six men and injured 19 others. After the shooting,
      Bissonnette was apprehended by officers six miles from the mosque. Over the
      last week, the court saw for the first time the methodical nature of Bissonnette’s
      attack on the mosque, in which he paused a number of times to reload his semi-automatic
      Glock handgun and shoot injured people on the ground. Video footage also shows
      the quick reactions of mosque attendees sheltering children and what prosecutors
      called the “heroism” of Azzeddine Soufiane, a grocer who was killed by Bissonnette
      as he attempted to tackle the gunman.'

    - Three Ecuadorian journalists who were abducted by dissident Colombian rebels
      have been murdered, Ecuador’s president confirmed on Friday. Lenín Moreno offered
      a reward of $100,000 for information that leads to the capture of the rogue
      guerrilla leader known by the alias “Guacho”, who is believed to be responsible
      for the abduction and murder of the journalists. Moreno said that Ecuador was
      “grieving” over the killed men, having previously given the captors 12 hours
      in which to prove that the hostages were alive before facing a military response.
      “We’re not going to let ourselves be intimidated,” he said. Moreno appeared
      make good on his threat, immediately ordering the resumption of military operations
      on the border and dispatching representatives from the Catholic church in order
      to mediate the recovery of bodies. “We can’t allow the criminals to impose their
      rules,” Moreno said in an earlier statement on Thursday night after he returned
      early from Peru, where he had been due to attend this weekend’s Summit of the
      Americas. “We’re going to fight them in the realm they have chosen and we are
      going to defeat them,” Moreno went on to say. Reporter Javier Ortega, photographer
      Paul Rivas and their driver Efraín Segarra, who work for Ecuadorian daily El
      Comercio, were kidnapped on 26 March by a holdout faction of Colombia’s Revolutionary
      Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, the leftist rebel group which laid down its
      weapons and became a political party after signing a 2016 peace deal. On Thursday,
      Colombia’s RCN network passed on to officials graphic photos purporting to show
      the men’s bodies, which Ecuadorian authorities are analysing. Moreno said there
      is an “enormous possibility” that images are authentic. About 1,200 former Farc
      rebels are believed to have joined dissident drug- trafficking factions, including
      the Oliver Sinisterra Front, which is believed to have kidnapped the men. A
      proof of life video was released last month showing the men calling on that
      country’s authorities to release three unidentified combatants and end anti-narcotics
      cooperation with Colombia in exchange for their freedom. The three men were
      kidnapped investigating heightened violence in Esmeraldas, a province on the
      Ecuadorian side of the 364-mile border. The region has long been a hotbed for
      Colombian drug traffickers and rebel groups (which are often the same), and
      has been the setting for a string of recent attacks against military targets.
      Moreno announced in March that he was boosting security to the region, sending
      12,000 soldiers and police to combat drug gangs. The uncertainty over the fate
      of the hostages has caused consternation among press freedom groups in both
      countries, who accuse both governments of acting too slowly. “We condemn the
      actions of the Colombian and Ecuadorian governments and their lack of seriousness
      in protecting the reporters’ lives,” a statement from Colombia’s Foundation
      for Press Liberty said. Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, has sent top
      military and police officers to Quito in order to assist with the crisis. “I
      spoke with Moreno, and I reiterated that he has and will have all of my support,
      and that of our armed forces and the Colombian people,” he tweeted on Thursday
      night.

    - 'Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby, pardoned in 2018 The former chief of staff to Vice-President
      Dick Cheney was convicted of perjury and obstruction for lying about his conversations
      with reporters about the outed CIA operative Valerie Plame. President George
      W Bush commuted his 30-month prison term but not his $250,000 fine. According
      to the New York Times, Bush and Cheney spent their final hours in office arguing
      over whether Libby should receive a pardon; Bush refused to grant one. Donald
      Trump pardoned him in 2018, saying: “I don’t know Mr Libby but for years I have
      heard that he has been treated unfairly.” Richard Nixon, pardoned in 1974 In
      the wake of the Watergate scandal, Nixon became the only US president in history
      to resign. His successor, Gerald Ford, had barely been in office for a month
      when he decided to pardon Nixon to avoid a protracted legal process. But, the
      New York Times reported: “At the White House, switchboard operators said, ‘angry
      calls, heavy and constant’, began jamming their boards soon after Mr Ford’s
      announcement.” Ford said in a 1984 interview: “The political fallout was far
      more serious than I contemplated.” Joe Arpaio, pardoned in 2017 Trump’s first
      use of the president’s pardon power came after seven months in the job, when
      he pardoned the former sheriff Joe Arpaio, the hardline Arizona lawman who was
      convicted of contempt of court in July for defying a judge’s order to stop racially
      profiling Latinos. During Arpaio’s 24-year tenure as sheriff of Maricopa county,
      he gained notoriety for detaining hundreds of undocumented immigrants in a Tent
      City jail and forcing them to wear pink underwear. The sheriff courted controversy
      and media attention as he became a national figurehead for the virulent xenophobia
      Trump embraced in his presidential campaign. Caspar Weinberger, pardoned in
      1992 The former defence secretary was the most senior member of Ronald Reagan’s
      cabinet indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Iran-Contra
      affair. The charges arose from his testimony that he did not know about the
      illegal sale of arms to Iran and anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua; his
      private notes later revealed this was untrue. President George HW Bush defied
      congressional opposition to grant Weinberger an executive pardon days before
      the case came to trial. Marc Rich, pardoned in 2001 The commodities trader fled
      to Switzerland in 1983, accused of evading $48m in taxes and illegally trading
      with Iran in oil. But Rich, whose ex-wife was a prominent fundraiser for the
      Democrats, was pardoned by Bill Clinton on his last day as US president in what
      a New York Times editorial called “a shocking abuse of presidential power and
      a reminder of why George W Bush’s vow to restore integrity to the Oval Office
      resonates with millions of Americans”. Chelsea Manning, sentence commuted in
      2017 The soldier was sentenced to 35 years in military prison for passing secrets
      to the website WikiLeaks about US operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Manning
      had served seven years when Barack Obama commuted the sentence just three days
      before he left the White House.'

    - One of the members of the Islamic State cell dubbed the Beatles is suspected
      of helping to organise a plot from Raqqa in Syria to shoot soldiers, police
      officers and civilians in London from the back of a moped. Alexanda Kotey, who
      was captured at the start of this year by the Syrian Democratic Forces while
      apparently fleeing after the collapse of Isis, is alleged to have been one of
      the four members of the group of jihadist extremists who held British and other
      foreign nationals. Members of the cell are accused of having beheaded prisoners
      including the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, the US journalists
      James Foley and Steven Sotloff and the US aid worker Peter Kassig. Kotey’s alleged
      role in the London plot was revealed by ITV News on Friday and independently
      confirmed by the Guardian. Details of the plot to kill British police and soldiers
      in drive-by shootings from a moped were set out at the Old Bailey two years
      ago. What is new is Kotey’s alleged involvement. He is reported to have been
      in regular contact with Tarik Hassane, who was jailed in 2016 for his part in
      the plot along with Suhaib Majeed, a physics student at King’s College, London.
      Hassane and Majeed had access to a gun, silencer and ammunition from a criminal.
      According to ITV, detectives working on the investigation have gathered enormous
      amounts of data, including commands sent by Isis fighters in Syria. Kotey, who
      has had his passport revoked, could eventually end up being tried either in
      the US or the UK.

    - 'Israeli forces stationed on the Gaza frontier have killed one person and wounded
      hundreds of Palestinians, who were demonstrating for the third week in a row.
      Health officials in Gaza said 363 people were injured by live ammunition and
      tear gas inhalation, although they did not provide a breakdown. They said a
      Gazan journalist was in a serious condition after being shot in the abdomen.
      The Palestine Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian organisation, has said one
      of its medics was shot in the knee. Rights groups accuse Israel of wanton use
      of live fire. Israel says the protests are a cynical ploy by Gaza’s rulers Hamas
      to stage attacks, including using explosives, or to breach the border. Close
      to 30 Palestinians – including Hamas militants, civilians and a video reporter
      – have been killed during the rallies, which started on 30 March. At five spots
      along the frontier, tent complexes have been erected hundreds of metres from
      the border where families have gathered. Crowds of mostly young men have moved
      closer, slinging stones, torching tyres and setting Israeli flags alight. East
      of Gaza City in the northern part of the coastal enclave, ambulances brought
      the injured to a field hospital where paramedics rushed to attend floods of
      patients. Several men, bandages wrapped around their calves and ankles, had
      been shot. One lay unconscious after a bullet had passed through his lower torso.
      Outside, at the entrance to the area, a large Israeli flag had been placed on
      the ground for people to walk over. And closer, across the beige and green fields
      towards the perimeter, thick black smoke from burning tyres rose high, the seaside
      winds pushing it into the skies above Israel. The protests began as a plan to
      peacefully gather near the border, an idea that has since been supported by
      Hamas and other political parties. Thousands have called for the “right of return”
      for refugees and their descendants to ancestral homes in Israel. Across the
      fence on the Israeli side, sniper teams lay low on sandbanks overlooking the
      area. An Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
      refused to detail specific rules for engagement that admitted live sniper fire
      or say how many people had been shot. Sitting under the shade of trees near
      the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, he said: “Using live fire is a last resort. Obviously,
      I’m not talking about a terrorist shooting but a person trying to approach the
      fence, cut the fence, throw a hand grenade.” All targets were chosen by commanders
      and shot by “well-trained” teams, he added, and every bullet fired had been
      recorded. No Israeli civilian or soldier has been harmed as a result of the
      rallies. The IDF sent footage to journalists on Friday of protesters attempting
      to pull down barbed wire using a rope. It said an “explosive device” had been
      detonated near the border and forwarded a photo of what it said was a “firebomb”
      attached to a kite. Human rights groups have decried the use of lethal force,
      saying live bullets should only be used when facing imminent mortal threats.
      Five former IDF members from sniper teams said in an open letter that they were
      “filled with shame and sorrow”. “Instructing snipers to shoot to kill unarmed
      demonstrators who pose no danger to human life is another product of the occupation
      and military rule over millions of Palestinian people, as well as of our country’s
      callous leadership, and derailed moral path,” they wrote.'

    - '5.30pm update: Emotional win for Woollacott Greg Wood: After the success of
      Lalor in the Grade One Top Novice Hurdle, the Aintree winner’s enclosure was
      thick with emotion for the trainer Kayley Woollacott, whose husband, Richard,
      was found dead in January at the age of 40. Lalor took a bumper event at this
      meeting 12 months ago to give Richard Woollacott his first Grade Two winner,
      and Lalor’s two-length victory yesterday was the first at the highest level
      for the West Country stable, where Kayley took over the licence after her husband’s
      death. “It’s a really emotional day and obviously I had a little bit of help
      from up there,” Wollacott said. “This was a really special horse for me and
      Richard. It’s unreal, we loved the horse from the moment he came to our yard.
      “Richard went to look at him and came back and said: ‘I’ve got to have this
      horse, I’ve got to find a way of having him.’ He turned up big, beautiful, backward
      and a bit gormless but lovely, and we’ve always been really excited about him.”
      “The horses have really kept everything going and me on the straight and narrow.
      They’ve been a big help and having ones like him in the yard make you want to
      do it. I’m so pleased for the owners, they’ve stuck by me and been so loyal,
      and it’s worked out. “Racing is one of the toughest games but it has shown how
      supportive it can be. [Racing people] have helped me find my feet.” The Topham
      Handicap Chase over the Grand National fences was run on heavy ground for the
      first time since 2001 when seven of 24 starters completed the course. Ultragold
      led home 14 finishers from a field of 27, and there were no reports of injuries.
      2.15pm update: National to be run on very testing ground Greg Wood: The Grand
      National at Aintree on Saturday afternoon will be run in the most demanding
      conditions for almost 20 years after 5mm of rain and then steady drizzle at
      the course on Friday changed the official going on the course to heavy, soft
      in places. The National has not been staged on heavy ground since 2001, when
      a total of 40 runners faced the starter but only four completed the course,
      including two that had been remounted. Nearly a third of the field was taken
      out of the race when a loose horse ran down the take-off side of the Canal Turn
      on the first circuit, and just seven were still standing after jumping the water
      with a full circuit of the track to go. “The ground is going to ride on the
      easier side,” Andrew Tulloch, Aintree’s clerk of the course, said on Friday,
      “but hopefully the rain should clear through and we should be dry tonight and
      tomorrow.” Three runners were scratched from the original final field of 40
      as a result of the change in the going, with all three being replaced by horses
      on the “reserve” list for the race. Minella Rocco, who had been due to carry
      top weight of 11st 10lb, was replaced in the field by Thunder And Roses, the
      Irish Grand National winner in 2015, while his absence also meant that the weights
      for the race were raised by 1lb with Blaklion taking over as the new top weight.
      Vicente, the winner of the Scottish Grand National for the last two years, was
      replaced by Sue Smith’s Delusionofgrandeur, and Paul Nicholls’s chaser will
      now attempt to complete a hat-trick at Ayr next weekend, while the withdrawal
      of Beeves shortly before the 1pm deadline for replacements gave amateur rider
      Sam Waley-Cohen a last-minute place in the National aboard Robert Walford’s
      Walk In The Mill.'

    - "“A girl, ladies and gentlemen! A bit of a girl clutching the neck of a bandy-legged
      outsider streaked across the line to win the greatest race in turfdom! A girl
      wins the Grand National!” Thus gabbles the radio commentator in the 1944 film
      National Velvet, heralding the success of a character played by Elizabeth Taylor.
      Three parts of a century have since rolled by and horse racing reporters are
      still waiting for their chance to trumpet such a line for real, hopefully without
      the patronising diminutive. But perhaps the moment is finally at hand because
      Saturday’s race will feature an almost unprecedented three female jockeys. They
      have not been booked for outsiders, bandy-legged or otherwise; their horses
      feature in the top half of the betting. Nor are they unknown teenagers, like
      Taylor’s character, but established riders of proven talent. On his way to Aintree
      on Thursday, the Telegraph’s man tweeted a picture of Enid Bagnold’s novel that
      was the source for National Velvet and asked: “Is this the most relevant form
      book for this year’s race?” Bagnold’s heroine, the strong-willed Velvet Brown
      with her uncanny empathy for a horse, is arguably a pallid creation by comparison
      with the effervescent Bryony Frost, who will take her first tilt at the National
      aboard Milansbar. Frost, a self-described “Devon dumpling” and the daughter
      of a National-winning rider, had a donkey for a babysitter from the age of two
      and used to fall asleep on his back. She was in pony races from the age of nine.
      If ever a person was born and raised to be a steeplechase jockey, she was. She
      will be joined in Saturday’s lineup by Rachael Blackmore, only the second female
      professional jockey in the history of Irish jump racing, and Katie Walsh, whose
      third place in the 2012 National is the best result achieved by a woman. Those
      coincidence backers annually drawn to the National may like to know that Walsh’s
      mount, Baie Des Iles, will carry the same saddle-cloth number (28) as did Taylor’s
      in the movie. The no-nonsense Walsh will surely take no interest in such a detail.
      Asked if this is a significant moment, she underlines the importance of opportunity.
      “The reality of it is that I’m riding for my husband. And Rachael has an association
      with Gigginstown, owners of her horse. And Bryony is riding a horse she won
      on last time. “Next year, that might not be the case. I wouldn’t be riding in
      the National, if I wasn’t riding one for Ross.” Walsh was born into a racing
      family, which opened doors. She is well aware other talented jockeys, male and
      female, are less fortunate. “It’s just so competitive. It’s a very small, condensed
      sport and there’s only room for a handful of people at the top.” Only once before
      have three women ridden in the National, 30 years ago. Penny Ffitch-Heyes and
      Venetia Williams were thrilled to be in the lineup but both were on no-hopers,
      at odds of 100-1 and 200-1 respectively, and neither got beyond the sixth fence.
      Gee Armytage fared better on Gee-A, leading the field on the run down to the
      second Becher’s before her horse tired. Female participation in the National
      had become the norm, soon after Charlotte Brew was the trailblazer in 1977.
      Over the next 12 years, 11 different women had rides in the race. Since then,
      only four new names have been added to the list. While Walsh and her sister-in-law
      Nina Carberry have had 11 rides between them, no other woman has lined up since
      2005. Where did all the female jump jockeys go? Some, including Armytage, have
      suggested trainers and owners were put off using women by a series of shocking
      injuries, including the death of Jayne Thompson at Catterick and the paralysis
      suffered by Sharron Murgatroyd and Jessica Charles-Jones in incidents at other
      tracks. Such things also happened to men, but female pain, according to the
      theory, was harder for some people to contemplate. That is not how Williams
      sees it, having had a long and successful career as a trainer. “I don’t think
      injuries are what put people off, really. Maybe that was the party line but
      we weren’t very good. End of. These girls are a hell of a lot better than we
      were in my day. “Gee Armytage might get a bit cross with me for saying that,”
      she adds, laughing, “but they’re streets better.” Thanks to the cumulative effect
      of Walsh, Carberry, Frost and Blackmore, it seems racing insiders are increasingly
      prepared to accept the right woman on the right horse can successfully fight
      her corner in any jumps race. Paul Nicholls, a former champion trainer, has
      given Frost a huge push. Gigginstown Stud, the dominant owner in Irish jumps
      racing, regularly employs female jockeys. There is still a widespread reluctance
      to accept that women can be as robust as men in coping with falls and recovering
      from injury. In February, Nicholls said of Frost: “I don’t think she wants to
      be getting loads of falls, she needs to be looked after a little bit. If she
      can pick and choose [her mounts], she can end up riding 50 winners a year, every
      year, for a good while and hopefully some good winners, that’s the thing.” Frost
      and Blackmore will inevitably, some day, get chances to prove how resilient
      they can be when injured. But when one reporter told Frost this week to “come
      back in one piece”, she just laughed. “I’m not worried about that,” she said.
      “Getting in the car is the most dangerous part of the day.”"

    - 'The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has boycotted a key donor
      conference in Geneva, accusing aid agencies of exaggerating the extent of the
      crisis in the vast central African country. Friday’s conference only raised
      $530m (£370m) of the $1.7bn that the UN has said is necessary to meet the humanitarian
      needs of millions of people suffering from war, displacement, disease and hunger.
      The United Nations has declared the situation in parts of DRC to be at level
      3, the body’s highest level of emergency. Lambert Mende, DRC’s information minister,
      told the Guardian the country had refused to attend the conference because it
      did not want to be “complicit in a swindle”. He said: “We have a group of UN
      bureaucrats who are trying to mislead the international community on the real
      situation of our people. We need humanitarian aid, but not of that order.” Officials
      in DRC claim only 230,000 people have been displaced, a fraction of UN estimates
      of 4.5 million. Mende said the UN, which has about 16,000 peacekeepers in DRC,
      was trying to justify its presence in the country. The government has recently
      made clear it wants the peacekeeping mission to end by 2020. The UK has announced
      an additional £22m of humanitarian assistance and called on DRC “to fully recognise
      the scale of suffering”. Harriett Baldwin, the UK’s minister for Africa, said:
      “This is a major humanitarian crisis and I have pressed for the DRC to … cooperate
      with international efforts to help the millions of Congolese people affected.”
      On the overall shortfall in funding, Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the
      Norwegian Refugee Council, said: “We are disappointed that too few countries
      sent a real message of hope to the millions of Congolese children, women and
      men in desperate need of assistance … While we welcome the pledges made today,
      the response is far from matching the spike in humanitarian needs in Congo.”
      DRC has been hit by violence, rebellions, protests and political turmoil in
      recent months, leading to fears over further unrest. Five million people died
      in the civil war between 1997 and 2003. The security situation has deteriorated
      markedly as government authority has collapsed, emboldening rival militia groups
      which control large areas of territory, often competing for DRC’s rich resources.
      More than 13 million Congolese people need humanitarian aid, twice as many as
      last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30% from a year ago,
      according to the UN. The crisis is most acute in the central Kasai region and
      in the east. Six rangers in Virunga national park were killed this week in an
      ambush, underlining the growing threat. Jean-Philippe Chauzy, DRC head of the
      UN migration agency IOM, described a visit to Kalemie, capital of the eastern
      Tanganyika province, where he saw 1,000 families camped in a schoolyard. “It
      reminded me of when I first read Dante’s Inferno – it was absolutely awful,
      living conditions were absolutely atrocious,” he told Reuters. “No proper water,
      people defecating wherever they could, shelters made of pieces of plastic or
      of rags on sticks.” Egeland said the “underfunded mega-disaster” in DRC received
      little international attention because migrants from the country did not arrive
      on European shores and the conflicts did not involve major powers. The instability
      has been aggravated by Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down as president at
      the end of his election term in 2016. Kabila, in power since 2001, is barred
      by term limits from standing for re-election. But opponents suspect he intends
      to try to change the constitution to run again, or further delay the poll. In
      a statement, a coalition of Congolese civil society groups said: “This humanitarian
      crisis is not a result of an unpredictable natural disaster; it is a manmade
      tragedy. It has been marked by violence, often state-sponsored, harsh political
      repression, and flagrant and repeated violations of our people’s most basic
      rights.” Moïse Katumbi, a leading opposition politician, called the government’s
      stance “criminal”. Jose Barahona, Oxfam’s DRC country director, said his organisation
      had been forced to halve food rations to 90,000 people in Kasai province. “The
      lack of funding forces us to make choices we shouldn’t have to make. Last month,
      we had to restrict the rations even further, with over a quarter of people receiving
      no food at all,” Barahona said. In the Kasai region, only 39% of people needing
      aid received help between October 2017 and the end of January 2018, aid agencies
      say. In Ituri, a province bordering Uganda, thousands are being forced from
      their homes by violence. Since December 2017, more than 100 people have been
      killed as villages, schools and health centres have been burned. Mende said
      DRC had tried to reach an agreement with the UN on the disputed statistics,
      but talks had not progressed beyond a first meeting. “We were very surprised
      by the hurry to hold this conference. If you want to take care of an ill patient
      you have to find out what the problem is first,” he said.'

    - 'Dominic Raab, the housing minister who claimed in an interview last week that
      immigration had “put house prices up by something like 20%” over the past 25
      years, has had to contextualise the figure. The UK Statistics Authority asked
      Raab, a leading Brexiter, to publish the evidence for his claim. A document
      published on Friday by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
      shows that the finding was based on an out-of-date model that had never been
      intended for this kind of analysis. Raab defended his use of the model, which
      estimates the impact of population growth, inflation, interest rates, housing
      stock and wage growth on house prices. He said he had been asked specifically
      about the impact of immigration. “I did indeed say care was needed with the
      data, and I was right that immigration put average prices up by 20%. We need
      a balanced approach.” The research was conducted using an affordability model
      described a decade ago in reports by the long-defunct National Housing and Planning
      Advice Unit. It shows that between 1991 and 2016, the population of England
      grew from 47.1 million to 54.5 million; the number of non-UK-born residents
      grew from 3.5 million to 8.4 million over the same period. But population was
      one of many factors that had a bearing on house prices. The impact of immigrant
      households is only a small part of the total. Real income growth, for example,
      would have pushed up prices by 150%, according to the analysis. The ministry
      insisted the information used by Raab was an accurate representation of the
      research. Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King’s
      College London, said it was a reasonable number to try to make a rough estimate,
      but the evidence on which Raab’s claim was based was so flimsy it could not
      be described as research. “The publication is of a standard that I am shocked
      that [the ministry] would publish. They’ve basically taken an out-of-date model
      ... it is a very crude back-of-the-envelope approach. It would nonetheless be
      acceptable to use it for a rough estimate of the impact of an extra 100,000
      immigrants next year. What you cannot do is apply that to immigration over 25
      years.” John Healey, Labour’s housing spokesperson, said: “The evidence is clear
      that immigration is not the major driver of rising housing prices. “Rather than
      try to blame others for unaffordable housing costs, Dominic Raab should look
      at the decisions Conservative ministers have made since 2010. Deep cuts to housing
      investment have halved the number of new low-cost homes for first-time buyers
      and driven the number of new social rented homes being built to a record low.”'

    - 'Former FBI director James Comey’s book details his early career as a prosecutor,
      and his work at the justice department and FBI under George W Bush and Barack
      Obama. But the chapters on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and the 2016 election
      have attracted most attention since the Guardian and others obtained copies
      of the book on Thursday. Here are the key points: First encounter with Trump
      Comey recounts his visit to Trump Tower in January 2017 to brief the president-elect
      for the first time. “His face appeared slightly orange,” he writes, “with bright
      white half-moons under his eyes where I assume he placed small tanning goggles,
      and impressively coiffed, bright blond hair, which on close inspection looked
      to be all his. I remember wondering how long it must take him in the morning
      to get that done.” Comey also writes that he surreptitiously checked the size
      of the president-elect’s hands; smaller than his own, but not noticeably smaller
      than usual. Russia Told of Russia’s attempt to influence the election in his
      favour, Comey writes, the president-elect and his advisers asked no questions
      about the apparent attack by a foreign power and concentrated only on the political
      implications and media strategies – while intelligence leaders stayed in the
      room. “Holy crap,” writes Comey, who has discussed at length his early career
      as a mob prosecutor, “they are trying to make each of us an ‘amica nostra’ –
      a friend of ours. To draw us in. As crazy as it sounds, I suddenly had the feeling
      that … the president-elect was trying to make us all part of the same family.”
      One-on-one When Comey and Trump spoke alone about the Steele dossier, with its
      claims of Russian connections, Trump began to talk obsessively about women who
      had accused him of sexual assault. Seeking to cut him off, Comey told him he
      was “not under investigation” personally. Comey says he did so despite the view
      of the FBI’s general counsel, Jim Baker, that such a statement was too narrow,
      given Trump’s leadership of a campaign that was being investigated. After the
      meeting, Comey went to the FBI building in Manhattan: “After the uncomfortable
      conversation I’d just had, it was like taking a shower.” ‘Pee tape’ In a phone
      call, Trump obsessed about the allegation he consorted with prostitutes in Moscow
      during Miss Universe in 2013: “I’m a germaphobe. There’s no way I would let
      people pee on each other around me.” “I actually let out an audible laugh,”
      Comey writes. “I imagined the presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow
      was large enough for a germaphobe to be at a safe distance from the activity.”
      ‘Mob boss’ Recounting an Oval Office meeting, Comey writes that Trump remained
      behind the Resolute desk, making his visitor uncomfortable, where George W Bush
      and Barack Obama took meetings on couches and chairs. Trump talked and talked.
      “I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against
      the mob,” Comey writes. “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control.
      The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things,
      large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization
      above morality and the truth.” Dinner for two At a group gathering at the White
      House, the 6ft 8in Comey tried unsuccessfully to blend into the curtains to
      avoid the president’s gaze. Later, Trump’s invitation to dinner at the White
      House is replayed like a scene from some Washington thriller – a single table
      in the middle of the Green Room, the two powerful men alone. Comey realised
      his own job security was “on the menu”. Of Trump’s now famous supposed demand
      for “loyalty”, Comey writes: “To my mind, the demand was like Sammy the Bull’s
      Cosa Nostra induction ceremony – with Trump in the role of the family boss,
      asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‘made man’.” Firing After Comey found
      out about his firing – like everyone else in the room in which he was giving
      a speech, via the TVs behind his podium – John Kelly, then secretary of homeland
      security, called to say “he was sick about my firing and that he intended to
      quit in protest. He said he didn’t want to work for dishonorable people who
      would treat someone like me in such a manner. I urged Kelly not to do that,
      arguing that the country needed principled people around this president. Especially
      this president.” Kelly is now (an out of favour) White House chief of staff.
      ‘Leaks’ Comey writes that as he did not trust the attorney general, Jeff Sessions,
      whom he describes as “overwhelmed and overmatched at his job”, and describes
      how as he was now a private citizen, he decided to “prompt a media story by
      revealing the president’s 14 February direction that I drop the Flynn investigation”.
      He sent a copy of an unclassified memo to the New York Times via a friend, Columbia
      professor Daniel Richman. “To be clear,” he writes. “This was not a ‘leak’ of
      classified information, no matter how many times … the president calls it that.”
      Clinton’s emails and his press conference Comey’s retread of the investigation
      into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server is painstaking and painful.
      “No matter what the honest outcome, the [FBI’s] credibility – and mine – would
      be damaged.” He adds: “Unusual transparency might be necessary to reassure the
      American people and to protect the institutions of justice.” Of the infamous
      July 2016 press conference at which he excoriated Clinton, but then said he
      would not charge her, he writes: “I knew this was going to suck for me. From
      the Democratic side would come predictable stuff about my wanting the spotlight,
      being out of control, driven by ego. From the Republican side would come more
      allegations of justice department incompetence or corruption. But I believed
      – and still believe, even in hindsight, it was the best thing for the FBI and
      for the Department of Justice.” He should, he adds, “have tried to find a better
      way to describe Secretary Clinton’s conduct than ‘extremely careless’”. 11 days
      before the election Shortly before election day, Comey was informed of “an enormous
      trove of Secretary Clinton’s emails” on a computer belonging to the disgraced
      husband of Clinton’s closest aide. “We really were screwed,” Comey writes, “…
      ‘avoid action’ was not an option. Speak or conceal – both terrible options.”
      He decided to inform Congress because he assumed, “as nearly everyone did, that
      Hillary Clinton would be elected president of the United States in less than
      two weeks [and] what would happen to the FBI, the justice department or her
      own presidency if it later was revealed, after the fact, that she still was
      the subject of an FBI investigation?” Obama Comey, a Republican, writes of a
      good working relationship with Barack Obama. In a one-on-one Oval Office meeting
      at the end of Obama’s presidency that foreshadows meetings with Trump, the president
      salutes his FBI director’s “integrity and ability”. Comey writes that he was
      moved “almost to the verge of tears” and told Obama: “I dread the next four
      years.” Judgment In a short and damning epilogue, Comey considers Trump’s character.
      “Our country is paying a high price” for the 2016 election, he says: “This president
      is unethical, and untethered to the truth and institutional values.” Trump’s
      presidency is like a “forest fire”, he says: “Important norms and traditions
      will be damaged by the flames. But forest fires, as painful as they can be,
      bring growth. In the midst of this fire, I already see new life – young people
      engaged as never before, and the media, the courts, academics, nonprofits, and
      all other parts of civil society finding reason to bloom.”'

    - 'The County Championship is not supposed to start with a whimper. Six games
      played, four called off without a ball bowled, at Headingley, Old Trafford,
      Edgbaston and Canterbury, and Middlesex against Northants curtailed by bad light.
      The one game to last the day was at Southampton, where Hampshire met Worcestershire,
      and James Vince did what James Vince does best. Fresh from a winter where he
      beguiled and frustrated, he beguiled and frustrated again – with the first fifty
      of the season and not a chance to slip, before missing a straight one from Steve
      Magoffin and being bowled, bails spurting in opposite directions, five minutes
      before lunch. His rollicking 75, at less than a run a ball, came after he had
      turned down Trevor Bayliss’s offer of an early-season rest. It was an innings
      to neither quash the doubters nor silence his supporters. To be continued. The
      other fifty of the innings came not from Hampshire’s two big-name winter signings,
      Sam Northeast, out driving for 17, or Hashim Amla, burly in early-season layers.
      Instead it was Gareth Berg who shepherded the tail during his unbeaten 75. Joe
      Leach, Worcestershire’s captain whose bowling led them out of Division Two last
      season, finished with four for 42. Worcestershire then lost two wickets in the
      evening gloaming. At Lord’s, a Middlesex line-up missing the familiar faces
      of Dawid Malan, Nick Gubbins, Eoin Morgan and Steve Eskinazi, struggled early
      on against Northamptonshire. The debutant Robbie White made an unhappy duck,
      but Paul Stirling and John Simpson took them from 63 for four towards respectability
      before play came to a premature close despite the efforts of the Lord’s floodlights.
      Their wonderfully named Australian, Hilton Cartwright, on his Championship debut,
      hit the first six of the season. For Lancashire, it was the first time there
      had been a washout at Old Trafford on the first day of the season since 1999
      – when the Championship also started on 13 April. At Headingley, meanwhile,
      where a single white rose was placed in the commentary box in memory of Dave
      Callaghan, conditions were, in the words of the director of cricket Martyn Moxon,
      “grim”. A sopping outfield means the game is unlikely to start at 11am on Saturday
      At Edgbaston, Warwickshire took the opportunity of the rainy day to reveal that
      their captain, Jeetan Patel, has signed a contract to stay in Birmingham until
      the end of 2019. In the words of Ashley Giles, Warwickshire’s director of cricket:
      “He’s arguably the best overseas player in the country and has been for some
      years.” The Championship lives to fight another day – if it can only get on
      the pitch.'

    - A murder investigation has been launched after a man and a woman were found
      dead at a flat in Worthing, West Sussex. Sussex police said the pair, who lived
      in the seaside town, were found at 1.51am on Friday morning and declared dead
      at the scene. Their next of kin have been informed. “At the present time we
      are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation,” said
      DS Adam Hibbert of the Sussex and Surrey major crime team. “Our enquiries are
      ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the deaths and we would discourage
      anyone from speculating as to what happened. “The man, believed to be in his
      40s, and the woman, believed to be in her 30s, who were known to each other,
      have not yet been formally identified. Our thoughts are with their families
      at this difficult time.” Forensics officers spent most of the day at the rear
      of the house in South Farm Road, while a police cordon covered part of the pavement
      and a car parked at the front. Heather Denyer, 24, a neighbour, said she came
      home at 1.40am from working in McDonald’s and was surprised to find large numbers
      of police cars in the street “This is a quiet neighbourhood,” she said. “The
      neighbours here know each other but the people who lived in that house kept
      themselves to themselves. We didn’t know them well.” Bruce Patel, who owns a
      newsagent opposite the house, told the Worthing Herald that he had spoken occasionally
      to the woman who lived in the house. “She was a nice lady,” he said. “I have
      never had any problems from them at all. They kept themselves to themselves
      really. “It is shocking. I have been here for 10 years and this is a lovely
      area. I have never heard of anything like this here before, so it is shocking
      that it is happening right outside my shop. I’m sure we will get to know the
      real story soon.”

    - A five-storey high depiction of an erect blue penis on a Stockholm apartment
      building is to be painted over just a week after its unveiling following a storm
      of complaints from neighbours. The company that owns the block, Atrium Ljungberg,
      told Aftonbladet it had seen the work by the artist Carolina Falkholt for the
      first time on Wednesday morning – along with other residents of the Swedish
      capital’s central Kungsholmen island. “Culture and art are important in developing
      interesting urban environments,” Camilla Klimt, the company’s marketing manager,
      told the paper. “Of course, we care about artistic freedom. But at the same
      time, we must respect neighbours’ opinions.” Klimt said the work would stay
      up for a short while so everyone interested could experience it. Although some
      people had welcomed the penis as an “important part of the debate about sexuality,
      body and gender”, others – especially neighbours – had “received it less well
      and perceived it as offensive”, she said. Atrium Ljungberg has allowed a collective
      of local artists, Kollektivet Livet, free rein to decorate the apartment block
      wall as it sees fit since 2008. The murals usually stay in place for at least
      six months before a new one is commissioned. Falkholt said at the unveiling
      that she hoped her blue penis would be better received in Stockholm than a similar
      pink one was when it appeared on the side of an apartment building in Manhattan’s
      Lower East Side in December. The New York work was painted over within three
      days instead of the intended three weeks after similar complaints from locals.
      But Falkholt said on Wednesday she thought the reaction in her native Sweden
      would be different. “I think perhaps it will be allowed to remain here, people
      will get the message and let it take its place in the debate,” she said. “I
      think there’s more intellectual space to discuss the subject, in a nuanced way.”
      She said she liked to think of the Stockholm painting – titled Fuck the World
      – as “a reincarnation”. Falkholt could not be reached for comment on Friday.

    - 'Donald Trump declared James Comey “a weak and untruthful slime ball” on Friday
      in response to a new book, in which the former director of the FBI caricatures
      him as a mafia don, and claimed: “It was my great honor to fire James Comey!”
      “James Comey is a proven LEAKER &amp; LIAR,” the president tweeted. “Virtually
      everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did
      – until he was, in fact, fired.” But history may not be rewritten quite so fast.
      As rage poured forth from the White House an elaborate rollout campaign for
      Comey’s memoir pressed on, with the release of a television clip on Friday in
      which Comey recounted having to brief the president on an intelligence report
      alleging that Trump had consorted with prostitutes in Moscow. The president’s
      reaction, according to Comey: “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” Scenes
      such as those fill A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership, a copy of which
      was obtained by the Guardian on Thursday. The book goes on sale on Tuesday,
      and Comey’s first television interview, with ABC News, is to be broadcast on
      Sunday, with a national author tour to follow. Judging by Trump’s obliging Twitter
      outburst on Friday morning – and his even angrier tweet that afternoon claiming:
      “No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!” – the book
      seems likely to make good on Comey’s desire for a showdown with the president,
      a clash with few precedents and unknowably wide implications. Comey and Trump
      will not be the only participants. “Your kakistocracy is collapsing after its
      lamentable journey,” tweeted John Brennan, a former CIA director, in reply to
      Trump’s post about the ex-FBI chief. The word means government by the worst
      people. On the other side, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told her
      regular press briefing: “The American people see right through the blatant lies
      of a self-admitted leaker.” She added: “Comey will be forever known as a disgraced
      partisan hack. One of the president’s greatest achievements will go down as
      firing James Comey.” A Washington Post-ABC News poll timed to the release of
      Comey’s book found that Americans thought Comey “more believable” than Trump
      by a 48-32 margin. And fact-checkers pointed out that contrary to Trump’s claim
      about Comey’s reputation, Comey was broadly popular among the FBI rank-and-file,
      which reacted to the director’s firing in May 2017 with shock and disbelief.
      Yet the reappearance of Comey may rank only second as the most threatening development
      for Trump’s presidency this week, following the raid by FBI agents on Monday
      of an office, residence and hotel room tied to Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime
      trusted lieutenant. A lawyer for Trump was in court in New York on Friday to
      ask a judge to let the president object to the disclosure of some of the records
      seized from Cohen. Behind the raids on Cohen lurked the power of the special
      counsel, Robert Mueller, whose pressure on the president has grown so strong
      that Trump is once again flirting openly with the idea of removing Mueller,
      or Mueller’s boss, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, or both. Most
      analysts believe that such a step would only deepen Trump’s troubles – the firing
      of Comey is exhibit A – but such analysis may hold little sway if Trump shares
      any of the rashness and lack of self-control of the man described by Comey in
      his book. In the preview television clip aired on Friday, Comey was merciless
      in depicting the president’s insecurity and cravenness. Trump, according to
      Comey, was bothered that his wife, Melania Trump, might believe allegations
      in a dossier compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele that he,
      Trump, had been in a Moscow hotel room with urinating prostitutes, Comey said.
      “He said, you know, ‘If there’s even a 1% chance my wife thinks that’s true,
      that’s terrible’,” said Comey. “‘And I remember thinking, ‘How could your wife
      think there’s a 1% chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in
      Moscow?’ “I’m a flawed human being, but there is literally zero chance that
      my wife would think that was true. So, what kind of marriage to what kind of
      man does your wife think there’s only a 99% chance you didn’t do that?” Asked
      if he believed Trump’s denial, Comey said: “I honestly never thought these words
      would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of
      the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013.
      “It’s possible, but I don’t know.” Comey was also asked if he should have told
      Trump that the Steele dossier contained research partly funded by Democrats.
      “I don’t know the answer to that,” he replied. “It wasn’t necessary for my goal,
      which was to alert him that we had this information.” In places in the book,
      Comey seems to lay traps for the notoriously thin-skinned president, who is
      known for making specious claims about vote tallies and crowd sizes despite
      the facts and long after the fact. Trump “appeared shorter than he seemed on
      a debate stage with Hillary Clinton”, Comey writes of their first meeting. He
      adds of Trump: “His face appeared slightly orange, with bright white half-moons
      under his eyes where I assume he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively
      coiffed, bright blond hair, which on close inspection looked to be all his.
      I remember wondering how long it must take him in the morning to get that done.”
      But the theme Comey favors most in the book is that of Trump as mobster. In
      this, the lawman knows whereof he speaks, having led prosecutions of major mob
      figures earlier in his career. “As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit,
      I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against
      the mob,” Comey writes. “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control.
      The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things,
      large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization
      above morality and the truth.” Of Trump’s now famous demand over dinner at the
      White House in January 2017, “I need loyalty”, Comey writes: “To my mind, the
      demand was like Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony – with Trump
      in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‘made
      man’.” Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs in Washington'

    - 'Carbon dioxide from ships at sea will be regulated for the first time following
      a historic agreement reached after two weeks of detailed talks in London. Shipping
      companies will halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under the plan,
      brokered by the International Maritime Organization and binding across its 170
      member states. The agreement will require a revolution among ships, which are
      overwhelmingly fuelled by heavy oils at present. In future, they will have to
      not only be more energy-efficient, but also make use of cleaner energy, in the
      form of batteries supplying electricity, solar and wind electricity generation,
      and perhaps even a return to sail in some cases, or more controversially to
      nuclear power, as some warships already use. Environmental campaigners said
      the plan was not enough given the urgency of tackling climate change, though
      they welcomed the deal, which has taken decades of work. Greenhouse gas emissions
      from shipping and aviation were omitted from the 1997 Kyoto protocol and have
      been excluded from regulations on carbon ever since, even though shipping is
      used for 80% of global trade. Although shipping accounts for only about 2% of
      global carbon emissions, it has been a cause of particular concern, both because
      of the increased need for transport under the globalising economy and because
      many ships use dirty, carbon-rich fuels such as heavy diesel, which would be
      banned in many countries from onshore transport. Campaigners said cuts of at
      least 70% from shipping emissions by 2050, compared with the 2008 baseline chosen
      by the IMO, would be needed to meet the aims of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement,
      under which countries have agreed that temperature rises should be limited to
      no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. John Maggs, president of the Clean
      Shipping Coalition and senior policy adviser at the campaigning group Seas at
      Risk, said: “We have an important agreement and this level of ambition will
      ultimately require a sector-wide shift to new fuels and propulsion technologies.
      But what happens next is crucial. The IMO must move swiftly to introduce measures
      that will cut emissions deeply and quickly in the short term – without these,
      the goals of the Paris agreement will remain out of reach.” Sveinung Oftedal,
      chair of the negotiations at the IMO for the Norwegian government, compared
      the achievement to the space race, saying: “Like Apollo 11 returning to Earth,
      we knew we needed to land and we did.” Countries holding out against a stronger
      agreement included Brazil, Panama, Saudi Arabia and the US, according to Bill
      Hemmings, shipping director at Transport &amp; Environment, an NGO. The EU and
      many Pacific islands were among those pressing for a stronger deal.'

    - 'A former Vote Leave staffer has become the third whistleblower to publicly
      accuse the EU referendum campaign of exceeding spending limits “on an industrial
      scale”. In written evidence to the Electoral Commission seen by the Guardian,
      Mark Gettleson, a communications consultant, claims two of Theresa May’s political
      advisers were among the senior directors at Vote Leave involved in assisting
      the activities of a youth group, BeLeave, which was ostensibly a separate organisation.
      Vote Leave donated £625,000 to BeLeave which then spent the money on digital
      advertising in the last critical days before the vote. The evidence forms part
      of the basis of a legal opinion submitted to the digital, culture, media and
      sport committee that argues that a series of electoral offences may have been
      committed by Vote Leave. The submission says that the commission should investigate
      whether any such offences were committed with the “knowledge, assistance and
      agreement” of key figures in the campaign including Stephen Parkinson and Cleo
      Watson, who both now work for the prime minister, and its chief strategist,
      Dom Cummings. Donations are legal if campaigns are genuinely separate. Gettleson
      has submitted correspondence, including emails to and from Parkinson and Watson,
      that appear to show they were directly involved in creating BeLeave’s campaign
      materials. Vote Leave has always maintained that it and BeLeave were separate
      entities and the Electoral Commission has already assessed the issue twice and
      found in favour of Vote Leave on both occasions. It has now reopened its investigation.
      The emails also suggest BeLeave, headed by a 23-year-old fashion student, Darren
      Grimes, was directed by Vote Leave. Official documents submitted to the commission
      claim BeLeave was a separate independent organisation, but Gettleson’s witness
      statement disputes this. In it he says: “That does not match my experience of
      it. It had no dedicated staff, Darren was a 22-year-old part-time volunteer
      based in the Vote Leave office who was doing social media and it had no money
      at all. It was literally Darren on Twitter and Facebook under the supervision
      of Vote Leave staff. “I was providing support with the overarching message of
      BeLeave and website creation and Darren was working within Vote Leave and continually
      asking me, Stephen, Cleo and the Vote Leave design team for support and assistance.”
      Gettleson, a friend of the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie
      who later briefly went into business with him, also worked for a period with
      Cambridge Analytica and said that he introduced Cummings to the firm’s Canadian
      affiliate, AggregateIQ (AIQ). In an email to the Observer last March, Cummings
      said AIQ had been found on the internet. Cached searches show AIQ had no internet
      presence at the time. The firm removed a quote from Cummings from its website
      that read: “We couldn’t have done it without them,” said AIQ when the Observer
      sent questions relating to the evidence from another Vote Leave whistleblower,
      Shahmir Sanni. Sanni, a volunteer for Vote Leave and BeLeave’s treasurer, came
      forward last month with evidence that the latter had no control over the former’s
      donation. “They just pretended to [donate the money],” he said. “We had no control
      over it.” In response, Parkinson issued a statement saying he and Sanni had
      been in a relationship and said he gave him “advice and encouragement” in that
      context. Parkinson added: “I can understand if the lines became blurred for
      him, but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign
      groups.” The statement was put out by an official spokesperson for the Cabinet
      Office and later May affirmed her support for her political secretary. Gettleson
      has submitted emails that suggest that Parkinson may have been involved in the
      activities of various “outreach” groups including BeLeave. In his statement,
      Gettleson said: “My understanding is that a lot of groups were created for cosmetic
      purposes to improve our chances of Electoral Commission designation.” A long
      email chain from 5 April 2016 show Parkinson directing Grimes and liaising with
      Vote Leave staff members including Watson about a photoshoot. In the email he
      asked Vote Leave’s creative video editor: “Are the photos on [your] camera?”
      The Vote Leave video editor later sent Parkinson images including one of Grimes
      and other BeLeave volunteers in front of the Houses of Parliament. This image
      was later used in a Facebook advertisement and submitted by Matthew Elliott,
      the chief executive of Vote Leave, to the high court in March as part of a judicial
      review brought by the Good Law Project against the Electoral Commission. Elliott
      submitted it as evidence of how Vote Leave and BeLeave were not in breach of
      UK electoral law because they were entirely independent campaigns. His witness
      statement says: “I thought it may assist the court in having examples of the
      campaign materials and I attach those … I can confirm distinct campaigns were
      run.” In other email correspondence, Watson, Vote Leave’s head of outreach,
      asks Gettleson to help the group Veterans for Britain with its website. This
      was another purportedly separate campaign that also received a donation of £100,000
      from Vote Leave that was also spent with AIQ. Emails appear to show Parkinson,
      Vote Leave’s national organiser, was involved in even minor creative decisions
      about the outreach groups. In one email, Gettleson asks him whether he can put
      the expense on his [Parkinson’s] credit card but Parkinson refuses: “I can’t,
      I’m afraid – it’s not VL spend.” Instead it is believed the expense went on
      Gettleson’s card and was refunded by Vote Leave. In another email, Watson praises
      Gettleson’s work on the BeLeave site as “amazing”. Tamsin Allen, a solicitor
      at the law firm Bindmans, said Gettleson had wished to remain anonymous and
      was named in documents as “J” but had been forced to go public because of legal
      action by Cummings against her and three barristers at Matrix Chambers – Clare
      Montgomery QC, Helen Mountfield QC and Ben Silverstone – who have written a
      legal opinion based on their assessment of the evidence. They have said there
      was “powerful evidence including contemporaneous correspondence” that Vote Leave
      and BeLeave were “intimately linked” and a “prima facie case that electoral
      offences were committed by Vote Leave in the EU referendum campaign and that
      these require urgent investigation”. Cummings has called Wylie and Sanni “liars
      and charlatans”. Allen said: “Mark gave his evidence to the Electoral Commission
      because he believed it was the right thing to do.” She said Gettleson was prompted
      by his belief that spending limits were being breached during the referendum
      campaign “in his words ‘on an industrial scale’”. She added: “The importance
      of Mark’s evidence has been underlined by Vote Leave’s reaction. In particular,
      Mark believes the outing of Shahmir was completely unjustifiable.” Neither Parkinson
      nor Watson responded to the latest allegations, but Watson has said previously:
      “I absolutely deny the charges against me.” In Parkinson’s previous statement,
      he said: “I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations during
      the referendum, and am confident that Vote Leave acted entirely within the law
      and strict spending rules at all times.” Vote Leave has repeatedly denied the
      coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate pursuant
      to electoral law. Veterans for Britain have not responded to the Guardian’s
      questions. The Cabinet Office declined to answer questions about why it – a
      branch of the civil service – had put out a statement on behalf of a political
      advisor or whose decision it was to reveal the sexuality of Sanni.'

    - 'Four Church of England bishops have joined a call for an immigration amnesty
      for people who moved to the UK from the Caribbean decades ago but now face uncertainty
      over their status. The bishops are urging people in their dioceses to sign a
      petition demanding an amnesty for those who arrived as minors between 1948 and
      1971. The petition, which had gathered almost 58,000 signatures by 5pm on Friday,
      also calls for the government to pay compensation for “loss and hurt”. This
      week, Caribbean diplomats in the UK condemned the Home Office’s treatment of
      many longterm Commonwealth-born UK residents as “illegal immigrants”. They called
      on the UK government to resolve an anomaly that has left many people being denied
      health services, prevented from working and facing destitution, detention and
      possible deportation despite having lived in the UK for decades. Thousands of
      people are encountering serious immigration problems because they have no documents.
      The Midlands bishops – Michael Ipgrave of Lichfield, Mark Rylands of Shrewsbury,
      Clive Gregory of Wolverhampton and Geoff Annas of Stafford – have signed the
      petition, along with the Rev Rachel Parkinson, the chair of the Methodist church
      in Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury. Referring to the “Windrush generation” – those
      that answered the call to come to the UK to work in essential services in the
      1950s and 60s – Ipgrave said: “As preparations are made to celebrate the 70th
      anniversary of [the arrival of] Windrush [the ship that brought some of the
      first migrants to the UK from the Caribbean], it saddens me greatly that people
      who have lived here their whole adult lives now face uncertainty and fear. “These
      are individuals in their 50s and 60s who have contributed to society and may
      have never known a home outside of the UK. I am urging people across the Midlands
      and beyond to join me in signing this petition to right this wrong.” The bishop
      drew attention to the case of Elwaldo Romeo, 63, who was told by the Home Office
      he was living in the UK illegally despite having arrived at the age of four.
      Romeo has been told to report fortnightly to Home Office premises, and offered
      “help and support on returning home voluntarily”. He has not visited Antigua,
      where he was born, for more than half a century.'

    - Fabiano Caruana has won two elite tournaments in a fortnight, jumped to No 2
      in the live ratings only 21 points behind the world champion, Magnus Carlsen,
      and starts play in the US championship in St Louis on Wednesday. America’s world
      title challenger is already putting psychological pressure on Carlsen, seven
      months before their 12-game world title series. While capturing the Grenke Classic
      at Baden-Baden, Caruana won his final two games with the unfavourable black
      pieces, and, just as in the candidates at Berlin, went for the full point in
      the last round when a draw would have ensured first prize. The 25-year-old downsized
      his result, saying he had played better in Berlin but “the work and the form
      I was in carried over here, I kept getting chances and I took them.” He could
      have lost twice, once a fleeting opportunity missed by Carlsen and the other
      when the No 1 woman, Hou Yifan, overlooked a study-like endgame win. Carlsen
      was also unbeaten but the Norwegian escaped against the German tailender Georg
      Meier who could have sacrificed both rooks for a brilliant mate which he missed
      in time pressure. While Caruana begins St Louis on Wednesday, Carlsen will start
      on Thursday at Shamkir, Azerbaijan, where his rivals include three of the candidates
      who Caruana outpaced in Berlin, plus Anish Giri who tied with the world champion
      at Wijk aan Zee. Then Caruana and Carlsen will be at the super-strong Altibox
      Norway event in May and June. Later still Carlsen will be at Biel, Switzerland,
      in July, while in September Caruana will lead the US team in the 150-nation
      Olympiad as they bid to repeat their gold medals of 2016. For both, this is
      an intense competitive programme compared with past world championships where
      the players would often prepare with their aides for weeks or months. It foreshadows
      a tight and close contest in November which is likely to go the distance. Since
      title matches were reduced to the best of 12 games, nearly half of them have
      been settled by speed tie-breaks. Right now, Carlsen and Caruana are evenly
      matched and in their 20s with many career years ahead, so there is the prospect
      of one of the great chess rivalries developing, like Alexander Alekhine v José
      Raúl Capablanca in the 1920s and 1930s, Mikhail Botvinnik v Vassily Smyslov
      in the 1950s, and Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov in the 1980s. Caruana broke
      another taboo in the final round at Grenke when he unleashed a startling opening
      novelty rather than hoard it until November. After 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 d4 Nxe4
      4 dxe5 d5 5 Nbd2 Qd7!? has the immediate idea that if White continues 6 Nxe4
      and swaps queens Black can retake with the knight on d7 rather than with king
      or bishop on d8. More subtly, the queen move prefaced a light square strategy
      for Black’s army. White lacked a decent middle game plan, and Vitiugov’s 10
      Ng5?! (10 Qd2) and 13 O-O?! (13 c3) allowed Caruana to improve his position.
      After 16…d4! Black was well on top as his Bd5 and Nf5 were monsters cramping
      White’s activity. 28 Bxf5 eliminated the dominating knight, but then Caruana
      had the bishop pair. The pressure mounted even after exchange of queens until
      36 Nxf5? (36 Nc2 is more resilient) conceded the exchange,after which Caruana
      quickly wrapped up the game. Nikita Vitiugov v Fabiano Caruana 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3

    - The former US ambassador to Vietnam has said he resigned last year in opposition
      to a Trump administration plan to deport more than 8,000 Vietnamese people,
      most of whom are refugees. Ted Osius, who worked in the US foreign services
      for 30 years, said the Trump administration asked him to press Vietnam’s government
      to accept the deportees – who had mostly fled the country after the fall of
      Saigon in 1975. “The majority targeted for deportation – sometimes for minor
      infractions – were war refugees who had sided with the United States, whose
      loyalty was to the flag of a nation that no longer exists,” Osius wrote in an
      essay for the Foreign Service Journal this month. “And they were to be ‘returned’
      decades later to a nation ruled by a communist regime with which they had never
      reconciled. I feared many would become human rights cases, and our government
      would be culpable.” Osius said the deportations would undermine the Trump administration’s
      other goals for relations with Vietnam, which included responding to the threat
      posed by North Korea. “I voiced my objections, was instructed to remain silent,
      and decided there was an ethical line that I could not cross if I wished to
      retain my integrity,” he wrote. A state department spokesperson said a top priority
      of the US government was deporting people with final orders of removal. “The
      US government requires the cooperation of foreign governments to facilitate
      the return of their nationals who have been ordered removed from the United
      States after exhausting their rights to legal process,” the spokesperson said.
      Up to 2 million refugees fled Vietnam following the war. Osius said many of
      those targeted by the Trump administration were tied to the US-supported state
      of South Vietnam, which has since collapsed. In 2008, the US and Vietnamese
      governments agreed that Vietnamese immigrants who arrived in the US before 1995
      would not be subject to deportation. Vietnam is, however, one of nine countries
      the US considers “recalcitrant” because it does not cooperate with US immigration
      removal orders, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Osius
      was dispatched to Vietnam in 2014 after working in India and Indonesia. He is
      now vice-president of Fulbright University Vietnam, a private, nonprofit institution
      in Saigon. In his essay, he referenced low morale in the US state department,
      but said he had also considered leaving the department under a past administration
      when he opposed the country’s approach toward North Korea. “The challenges to
      the foreign service, and to our democracy, are existential. Some who remain
      at state feel besieged and demoralized,” Ossius said. “Yet I urge those foreign
      service officers who believe in making a difference to remain, if possible,
      because it is still a privilege to serve our country.”

    - 'Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK must lead at the United Nations security council
      to bring the US and Russia together to end the conflict in Syria, insisting
      it is “never pointless” to push for UN involvement. The Labour leader and his
      Liberal Democrat counterpart, Vince Cable, were to receive a security briefing
      from the government on Friday afternoon. Corbyn insisted in an interview earlier
      in the day that he wanted to see the evidence of who was behind the apparent
      chemical weapons attack in Douma. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has
      said his country has seen evidence the attack was carried out by Bashar al-Assad’s
      government, and Theresa May has said her administration considers it highly
      likely Syrian forces were behind it. Corbyn said those who had perpetrated the
      attack should be held responsible, but that judgment should wait until after
      a UN investigation. “It’s up to the UN as the primary actor in the international
      community to find out who did it. I want to know who did it. If there is proof
      the regime did it, they must be held responsible. If there’s a proof anybody
      else did it, they must be held responsible,” he said. Corbyn had requested the
      security briefing on privy council terms, which are normally granted to opposition
      leaders at the government’s discretion on matters of national security. In his
      interview with Sky News, Corbyn pointed to the 2013 investigation into the chemical
      weapons attack in Ghouta and the agreement reached between the then US secretary
      of state, John Kerry, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to allow
      the destruction of large quantities of chemical weapons in Syria. “I think we
      do need the same spirit between Russia and the US, and I hope that is going
      to be possible,” he said. “I would say very strongly to Russia and the US: ‘Stop
      blocking each other’s resolutions.’ Maybe a British-sponsored resolution on
      this would be a helpful way forward?” Russia has repeatedly used its security
      council veto to block resolutions on Syria, including one on Tuesday that would
      have established an independent investigation into the suspected use of chemical
      weapons. Corbyn denied that it was pointless, given Russia’s record, to continue
      to call for UN investigations. “It’s never pointless calling for that, anything
      that brings a cessation of the use of chemical weapons moves us nearer, if not
      totally to, a ceasefire and a reopening of the Geneva talks which has got to
      be the right way forward,” he said. Corbyn did not say he regretted voting against
      airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria in 2015, but he did admit the action
      had “might have isolated and destroyed support for Isis”. “I took those decisions
      with my eyes open and my views because my default position is to save human
      life,” he said. Downing Street insisted on Friday that there was no set timetable
      for any potential military action to begin. May will come under increasing pressure
      from her backbenchers to grant a Commons vote on the matter if there are no
      further developments before the House of Commons returns from Easter recess
      on Monday. Earlier on Friday, Corbyn also accused May’s government of “waiting
      for instructions” from the US on how to proceed in the Syrian crisis, but that
      Donald Trump was giving “alarmingly contradictory signals”. Diane Abbott, the
      shadow home secretary, said the Labour party believed there was no military
      answer to the Syrian crisis. Asked whether Labour did not believe in military
      action in any circumstances, she said: “No. There was the second world war.”'

    - 'There are parts of Southampton’s Ocean Village, the marina development where
      the health secretary Jeremy Hunt has bought seven new apartments, that feel
      as antiseptic as any hospital ward. Originally a working dock dating back to
      the mid-19th century, it was redeveloped into a leisure marina in the mid 1980s
      and now – after almost as many false dawns as Hunt himself – looks pristine
      and prosperous. The site houses the usual clutch of bars and restaurants, as
      well as a hotel designed to look like a cruise liner, a spa and numerous quayside
      houses and apartments overlooking a marina filled with luxury yachts. The most
      recently added accommodation block is the architecturally unremarkable Alexandra
      Wharf development, which caught the eye of Hunt – if not his administrative
      staff. It contains 82 two- and three-bedroom apartments, featuring open-plan
      living rooms and kitchens, with prices advertised between £450,000 and £1m.
      For anybody interested in investing alongside the cabinet minister, there remain
      20 unsold, according to one person working on site, meaning Hunt has accounted
      for more than 10% of the units acquired so far. Still, while the upmarket estate
      agency Savills has made sales, and some flats are said to have been occupied
      since the beginning of the year, the building feels deserted. One new resident
      said that, despite the sales statistics, they had not seen much evidence that
      many of the flats were being used at all. “I’ve not seen a lot of people. In
      two days I’ve seen one person,” he said. “You can tell [that there are not many
      residents] from the parking lot. There are only about four or five cars.” A
      quick look underneath the building, in the private underground car park, seems
      to confirm this: residents are spoilt for choice about where to leave their
      vehicles. Ringing the doorbells of the apartments does not get you much further,
      either. Nobody answers when you make a call on Hunt’s flats, while a neighbour
      who has bought one of the apartments for herself quickly tires of being questioned
      over the intercom and hangs up. There is some support for Hunt among those people
      taking a bracing stroll along the marina (“we look forward to him moving in”,
      said one), but it is easier to find critics. One Dutch visitor said the story
      of Hunt’s undisclosed apartments sounded familiar. “We had this issue in the
      Netherlands,” he said. “A minister had a house he forgot to tell anybody about.
      It was just a gift!” “It is out of order,” added another passerby when asked
      about Hunt’s oversight. “He should declare everything. He isn’t exactly short
      of a few bob. He’s got £15m and he has not even declared a couple of flats.
      It’s ridiculous.”'

    - 'Two gang members who ran a so-called “county line” drug network have been jailed
      for human trafficking offences. Mahad Yusuf, 20, and Fesal Mahamud, 19, pleaded
      guilty in December to trafficking a vulnerable 19-year-old woman who was forced
      to transport drugs from London to Swansea. On Friday, Yusuf was sentenced to
      nine years in prison while Mahamud was jailed for 10 years. Both men were also
      made subject of a 20-year slavery trafficking prevention order. The case is
      thought to be the first in UK legal history in which police have successfully
      used powers under the Modern Slavery Act to target members of a city gang supplying
      class A drugs into county or coastal locations. The investigation, which started
      in March last year, focused on a London-to-Swansea “county line” operated by
      members of a street gang based in Enfield, east London. On 25 May, officers
      from Trident, working in conjunction with South Wales police, identified an
      address in Swansea suspected of being used by the gang to supply class A drugs.
      During a search of the premises a 19-year-old teenager who had been reported
      missing from her home in London was found. She had been beaten and forced to
      store class A drugs inside her. The gang had lured the teenager into a car in
      north London five days earlier following a brief exchange on social media. She
      was then driven to south Wales to be met by Yusuf, who told her “she belonged
      to him”. Her mobile phone was destroyed. DI Rick Sewart, of the Met’s Trident
      and Area Crime Command who led the investigation, said the victim has suffered
      a “horrendous ordeal” and paid tribute to her “courage and bravery”. “Her bravery
      has undoubtedly prevented other people from being exploited,” he said. “Today’s
      sentence reflects the seriousness of this heinous crime and sends a message
      that the exploitation of young people will not be tolerated.” Det Supt Tim Champion,
      lead officer for the Met’s county lines investigations, said: “Drug supply is
      not new, however the exploitation of young and vulnerable people by criminal
      networks, to move and supply drugs across the country, takes this offending
      to a new level. “We will prioritise these criminal networks and utilise all
      legislation available to disrupt their offending and safeguard those caught
      up in ‘county lines’. These offenders are trafficking young people to maximise
      their profits in the drug market and the use of the Modern Slavery Act is a
      proportionate and necessary response.”'

    - 'Bill Cosby’s main accuser at his retrial for sexual assault took the stand
      on Friday and said she was seeking justice in a 13-year legal battle with the
      TV celebrity. Andrea Constand, 45, appeared in a courtroom in Cosby’s home county
      in Pennsylvania for the second time in 10 months, the first trial last June
      having ended in a hung jury. The Canadian massage therapist has been alleging
      publicly since she first went to police in 2005 that the comic drugged and molested
      her at his mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs. Constand was asked by a prosecutor,
      Kristen Feden, to state why she was present at the trial. Sitting just 15ft
      from the star of The Cosby Show, she replied: “For justice.” How Constand’s
      testimony will play with the seven men and five women of the jury will hold
      the key to Cosby’s fate. He faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault,
      all relating to the alleged 2004 encounter with Constand and each bearing a
      sentence of up to 10 years in prison. If found guilty, the 80-year-old TV star
      could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Constand recalled the events of
      January 2004 when she was invited to Cosby’s home having become his friend when
      she was managing the women’s basketball team at Temple University, where he
      was a trustee. The TV star offered her three blue pills, she said, which he
      called “your friends. They’ll help take the edge off.” The witness said: “I
      trusted him. So I took them.” Soon after, she said, she started having double
      vision. “I looked at Mr Cosby, and I said: ‘I see two of you.’” She passed out
      on a sofa. The next thing she remembered, she told the jury, was waking with
      a jolt. “I felt Mr Cosby on the couch behind me, and my vagina was being penetrated
      quite forcefully, and I felt my breasts being touched.” Dana DiFilippo of Philadelphia
      public radio reported that Constand accused Cosby of placing her hand on his
      penis: “I was not able to do a thing to fight back. I wanted it to stop.” She
      left the mansion around 4am or 5am the next day. Constand’s testimony was buttressed
      earlier this week by the evidence of five women who all told strikingly similar
      stories of having been lured by Cosby with the promise that he would mentor
      and coach them, only to find their trust in him shattered when he allegedly
      sedated and then violated them. Prosecutors are hoping the cumulative impact
      of so many echoing accounts – in contrast to the first trial in which only one
      other woman was allowed to address the jury – will tip the outcome towards a
      guilty verdict. The five women included the most famous of Cosby’s alleged victims,
      the former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who in a feisty appearance in the witness
      stand on Thursday accused the comic of drugging and raping her in Lake Tahoe,
      California, in 1982. Dickinson, 63, said that the comic attacked her having
      given her a blue pill to assuage menstrual cramps. “I remember thinking, ‘What
      the heck is he doing?’ I was just in shock. Here was ‘America’s Dad’ on top
      of me, a happily married man with five children. I remember thinking how wrong
      it was – how very, very wrong it was.” Cosby’s defense team, newly assembled
      since the first trial, has sought to discredit Constand in the eyes of the jury
      by portraying her as a con artist whose only motive in accusing the celebrity
      of sexual crimes was to get money off him. In relentlessly aggressive opening
      arguments, lead defense attorney Tom Mesereau, the white-haired Hollywood lawyer
      who successfully defended Michael Jackson in his child molestation trial, suggested
      Constand “hit the jackpot” when Cosby paid her $3.4m to settle a 2006 civil
      suit she had brought against him.'

    - Tesla email reveals company’s effort to silence an alleged victim with cash
    - 'When a worker alleged discrimination, the company sought to keep him quiet:
      ‘If there is media attention, there will be no deal’'
    - https://media.guim.co.uk/c7cd52ae01a3815123fd8981220b48026fcc34d4/0_233_3500_2101/500.jpg
    - 'Tesla had a clear message to DeWitt Lambert, a black employee alleging racial
      discrimination: take our money and stay quiet. “In terms of settlement, we are
      willing to pay Mr. Lambert [redacted], but only if we are to resolve this matter
      before there is media attention, preferably within the next few hours,” the
      Tesla general counsel, Todd Maron, wrote to the worker’s lawyers last year.
      “If there is media attention first, there will be no deal.” The message, which
      a lawyer shared with the Guardian this week, provides a stark illustration of
      what some say is Tesla’s aggressive legal and media strategy in the face of
      serious complaints and potential negative press. The controversial PR tactics
      of Elon Musk’s car company have been on full display this week as the corporation
      has worked to publicly blame the victim of a fatal crash involving its autonomous
      technology. In the three weeks since the death of Walter Huang, 38, whose Tesla
      Model X crashed while in Autopilot mode in California, the company has repeatedly
      argued that the victim was at fault, not its nascent technology, and it has
      openly feuded with US investigators about the release of information. The defensive
      statements amid the current tragedy and the settlement offer in Lambert’s labor
      dispute provide a window into the way Musk’s firm has tried to silence critics
      – or publicly attack them. It’s a familiar approach in Silicon Valley, where
      companies work to block bad publicity by keeping complaints out of court and
      resolving high-profile disputes behind closed doors. But some say the tactics
      are particularly intense at Tesla, a firm that often receives fawning coverage
      from the tech press surrounding Musk’s ambitious projects and celebrity status.
      Lambert, an electrician hired as a production associate in 2015, alleged in
      a harassment, retaliation and discrimination lawsuit that he was subject to
      “repeated racist epithets for months”, including “violent” rhetoric and attacks
      using the N-word. Last year, Tesla emphatically denied the claims in lengthy
      statements that sought to cast doubts on Lambert’s character and alleged that
      his lawyer was engaged in a “media blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous
      narrative”. Lambert’s attorney, Larry Organ, who has faced repeated criticisms
      from Tesla surrounding his civil rights litigation, shared the attorney’s settlement
      email with the Guardian as an example of the corporation’s efforts to stop bad
      press and silence workers with complaints. The March 2017 email from Maron said
      if Lambert rejected the settlement and spoke out, “we will of course point out
      all of the facts in the attached document”. The document, according to Organ,
      attacked Lambert’s character. Organ further said Tesla had offered to have Musk
      meet Lambert as part of a settlement. “Tesla is a big corporation, and they
      feel like they can bully people,” Organ said in an interview. “And shut them
      up with money,” added Navruz Avloni, another attorney representing Lambert.
      A Tesla spokesperson did not deny the contents of the email, but alleged that
      Maron was responding to a “breathtaking” demand for money and threat to go public
      with a story. The company initially refused to provide a statement, but after
      publication of this story, a spokesperson said in an email: “The characterization
      of this email exchange is misleading.” He added that Organ’s “demand” was “beyond
      extreme and totally unwarranted given the facts of the case, and amounted to
      extortion, so our general counsel instead proposed a resolution that would actually
      be fair”. Organ told the Guardian the offer they discussed was just under $1m:
      “It seems to me they put a fairly low value on stealing a man’s dignity.” There
      are numerous examples of highly combative PR and legal strategies by Tesla in
      the wake of scandal. This week, attorneys for Huang’s family alleged that Tesla’s
      Autopilot feature was “defective” and “likely caused Huang’s death” when the
      car collided into a median. Tesla, however, said it was Huang’s fault: “The
      crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead,
      which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang
      was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings
      to do so.” Tesla’s statement expressed condolences to the relatives, who gave
      a television interview about their grief. But the company also said: “The reason
      that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.”
      On Thursday, Tesla also went after the National Transportation Safety Board
      (NTSB), a US agency that accused the company of improperly releasing information
      about the crash investigation. “It’s been clear in our conversations with the
      NTSB that they’re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting
      safety,” Tesla said in a statement announcing it would make an “official complaint
      to Congress”. Tesla has previously attacked the media in response to reporting
      on discrimination claims. After a female engineer shared her allegations of
      harassment with the Guardian, Tesla issued lengthy statements criticizing the
      woman and ultimately fired her, accusing her of pursuing a “miscarriage of justice”.
      Tesla has also vehemently denied her underlying claims. Musk has also been personally
      defensive about claims that his factory is unsafe for workers. After the first
      fatal crash involving Autopilot in 2016 – when Tesla’s technology did not prevent
      a car from colliding with a large white truck – the company defended its product.
      The family of that victim, Joshua Brown, eventually released a statement that
      said “Joshua loved his Tesla” and that the car was not at fault. Paul Grieco,
      an attorney for Brown family, said this week he couldn’t comment on whether
      Tesla paid money or had relatives sign any kind of confidentiality agreement.
      Tesla also declined to comment. “The parties were able to resolve their disputes
      amicably,” Grieco said, later adding: “I cannot comment on any of the settlement
      terms.”'

    - Tesla car that crashed and killed driver was running on Autopilot, firm says
    - Company says driver took no action despite system’s warnings in latest accident
      involving self-driving technology
    - https://media.guim.co.uk/9748c35a34091c43f0ead9a4a6bb2f16d135ff83/207_0_2587_1553/500.jpg
    - Tesla has said a car that crashed in California last week, killing its driver,
      was operating on Autopilot. The 23 March crash on highway 101 in Mountain View
      is the latest accident to involve self-driving technology. Earlier this month,
      a self-driving Volvo SUV that was being tested by the ride-hailing service Uber
      struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Federal investigators are looking
      into the California crash, as well a crash in January of a Tesla Model S that
      may have been operating under the Autopilot system. In a blogpost, Tesla said
      the driver of the sport-utility Model X that crashed in Mountain View, 38-year-old
      Apple software engineer Wei Huang, “had received several visual and one audible
      hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected
      on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. “The driver had about five
      seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider … but the
      vehicle logs show that no action was taken.” Tesla also said the concrete highway
      divider had previously been damaged, increasing its impact on the car. The vehicle
      also caught fire, though Tesla said no one was in the vehicle when that happened.
      The company said its Autopilot feature can keep speed, change lanes and self-park
      but requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel,
      in order to be able to take control and avoid accidents. Autopilot does not
      prevent all accidents, Tesla said, but it does make them less likely. “No one
      knows about the accidents that didn’t happen,” Tesla said, “only the ones that
      did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate
      belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. “There are about 1.25
      million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla
      vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year.”
      The company added that it “care[s] deeply for and feel[s] indebted to those
      who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people
      now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves
      safety. “None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much
      we feel for our customer’s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their
      loss.”
